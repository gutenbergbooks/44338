<h2><br />THE HOUSE OF GUISE.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>


<p>Upon the page of history are inscribed
the names of many great
men, uncrowned, but more illustrious
than most kings, whose biography
essentially involves the records of
their country and times. The cases
are very rare in which this occurs of
an entire lineage; when through
several successive generations the
same extraordinary qualities are
transmitted, and the hero or statesman
who perished yesterday, to-day
and to-morrow seems to start again
to life in the persons of descendants
who rival and even eclipse his fame.
These remarkable and most unfrequent
instances are exemplified in
the house of Guise, those puissant
nobles of Lorraine, immigrant into
and naturalised in France, who for
eighty years led the armies and directed
the councils of their adopted
country. Great warriors, bold and
profound politicians, unscrupulous and
interested champions of Rome, alternately
defenders of and competitors
for thrones, they upheld their power
and pretensions by the double lever of
religious enthusiasm, and of skilful
appeals to the sympathy of the people.
Rich in glory, in wealth, in
popularity, they were alternately indispensable
and formidable to their
sovereigns, and were virtually the
last representatives of that energetic,
able, and arrogant aristocracy, whose
services to the state were often limited
by the jealousy their power inspired,
and whose patriotism was not unfrequently
tarnished by their factious
temper and unbounded ambition.
From an early period of the sixteenth
century, the influence of Guise was
felt in France, for the most part
paramount to that of royalty itself;
until the might and glory of the house
sank and disappeared beneath the daggers
of assassins, and before the conquering
sword of the Fourth Henry.</p>

<p>The history of France during the
sixteenth century necessarily comprises
the public acts of the family
of Guise, and the memoirs of the time
abound in personal details of the
members of that renowned house;
but a work especially devoted to
them was still a desideratum, until
the appearance of that which M.
Réné de Bouillé has just produced.
One of the chief difficulties of his
task must have been to avoid including
the history of the century
in that of the extraordinary men so
intimately connected with its chief
events. Whilst confining himself as
much as possible to his immediate
subject, he has yet, as he himself
says, found his horizon of necessity
extensive. And in order to assemble
in one frame the various members of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
that celebrated family, he has been
compelled to admit with them a host
of other personages, who in their turn
have brought a retinue, and have insisted
on at least a corner of the
canvass being allotted to their deeds.
The manner in which M. de Bouillé
has treated this great historical
picture, whose magnitude and difficulty
must have deterred a less
zealous and persevering artist, is
most judicious. "I have been as
sparing as possible of discussion," he
says, "prodigal perhaps, on the
other hand, of cotemporary evidence,
of faithful quotations, of such details
as bring facts into a stronger light,
exhibit the actors on the stage in a
more animated manner, and display
and make known, of and by themselves,
the personages, parties, manners
and spirit of the times, and the
character of the situations." M. de
Bouillé claims, as a matter of justice,
credit for conscientious application,
and declares his whole aim will have
been attained if his work be admitted
to possess historical interest and
utility. No impartial critic will
refuse it these qualities. It is at
once substantial and agreeable;
valuable to the student, and attractive
to those who consider histories
of the Middle Ages as fascinating
collections of strange adventures and
romantic enterprises.</p>

<p>Réné the Second, reigning duke of
Lorraine&mdash;the same who fought and
conquered with the Swiss at Morat,
and defeated Charles the Bold at
Nancy&mdash;desired to see one of his sons
settled in France. He selected the
fifth, Claude, to whom he left by will
his various lordships in Normandy,
Picardy, and other French provinces,
causing him to be naturalised a
Frenchman, and sending him at a
very early age to the court of France,
where he was presented as Count de
Guise, a title derived from one of his
domains. The young count found
immediate favour with Louis XII.,
to the hand of whose daughter Renée
he was considered a likely aspirant.
But he fell in love with Antoinette
de Bourbon, daughter of Count de
Vendôme, (the great-grandfather of
Henry IV.,) asked and obtained her
in marriage, and celebrated his wedding,
when he was but sixteen years
of age, in 1513, at Paris, in presence
of the whole French court. The
following year another wedding occurred,
but this time youth was on
one side only. In his infirm and
declining age, Louis XII. took to
wife the blooming sister of Harry
VIII. of England, and honoured
Guise by selecting him to go, in company
with the Duke of Angoulême
and other princes of the blood, to
receive his bride at Boulogne. The
wedding was quickly followed by a
funeral, and Francis I. sat upon the
throne. This chivalrous and warlike
monarch at once took his young
cousin of Guise into high favour, to
which he had a fair claim, not only
by reason of his birth, and of his
alliance with the house of Bourbon,
but on account of his eminent capacity,
and of the martial qualities
whose future utility Francis doubtless
foresaw. To his triumphs in the
field, Guise preluded by others less
sanguinary, but in their kind as brilliant,
in the lists and in the drawing
room. His grace and magnificence
were celebrated even at a court of
which those were the distinguishing
characteristics, thronged as it was
with princes and nobles, most of
them, like the king himself, in the first
flush of youth, and with keen appetites
for those enjoyments which their
wealth gave them ample means to
command. He gained great credit
by his prowess at the jousts and
tournament held at Paris on occasion
of the coronation, and his conduct
in another circumstance secured
him the favour of the ladies of that
gallant and voluptuous court. "One
night," says his historian, "he accompanied
Francis I. to the queen's circle,
composed of those ladies most distinguished
by their charms and
amiability. Struck by the brilliancy
and fascination of the scene, unusual
at a time when custom, by assigning
to women a sort of inferior position,
or at least of reserve, interdicted their
mingling in the conversation, and to
a certain extent in the society of
men, Guise communicated his impression
to the king, who received it
favourably, and at once decided that,
throughout the whole kingdom,
women should be freed from this
unjust and undesirable constraint."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
It will easily be conceived that such
an emancipation insured Guise the
suffrages of the fair and influential
class who benefited by it. From his
first arrival at the French court he
seems to have made it his study to
win universal favour; and he was so
promptly successful that, at the end
of a very few months, he had conquered
the goodwill of both nobility
and army. He took pains to study
and adapt his conduct to the character
of all with whom he came in
contact, thus laying the foundation
of the long popularity which he and
his successors enjoyed in France.</p>

<p>But courtly pleasures and diversions
were quickly to be succeeded by the
sterner business of war. At his death,
Louis XII. had left all things prepared
for an Italian campaign; and
Francis, eager to signalise his accession
by the recovery of the Milanese,
moved southwards in the month of
August 1515, at the head of the finest
troops that had yet crossed the boundary
line between France and Italy.
His army consisted of fifteen thousand
excellent cavalry, twenty-two thousand
lansquenets, fourteen thousand
French and Gascon infantry, besides
pioneers and a numerous artillery.
The Constable of Bourbon led the van,
the Duke of Alençon commanded the
rear; Francis himself headed the
main body, accompanied by Duke
Anthony of Lorraine, (eldest brother
of Guise,) with Bayard for his lieutenant,
and by the Duke of Gueldres,
captain-general of the lansquenets,
whose lieutenant was the Count de
Guise. If the army was good, none,
assuredly, ever reckoned greater warriors
amongst its leaders. Guise, during
the passage of the Alps&mdash;accomplished
by extraordinary labour, and
which completely surprised the enemy&mdash;made
himself remarkable by his
constancy and activity, by the wisdom
of his counsels, and by his generosity
to the soldiers, thus further augmenting
the affection they already bore
him. Bayard and other illustrious
officers formed his habitual society;
and in him they found the most cordial
and affable of comrades, as well
as the most zealous advocate of their
interests with the king. Devoted to
his sovereign, Guise, when Francis
somewhat over-hastily promised the
Swiss an exorbitant sum of money as
the price of the Milanese, nobly offered
to contribute to it to the extent of all
he possessed. The treaty, however,
was broken by the Swiss. Steel, not
gold, was to settle the dispute; and
the plains of Marignano already trembled
at the approach of the hostile armies.
At the age of eighteen, Guise
found himself general-in-chief of
twenty thousand men. The Duke of
Gueldres, having been recalled to his
dominions by an invasion of the Brabanters,
transferred his command to
his young lieutenant, at the unanimous
entreaty of the lansquenets, and
in preference to all the French princes
there present. In the quickly ensuing
battle, Guise showed himself worthy
of his high post. In the course of the
combat, when the Swiss, with lowered
pikes and in stern silence, made one of
those deadly charges which in the
wars of the previous century had more
than once disordered the array of Burgundy's
chivalry, the lansquenets, who
covered the French artillery, gave
way. Claude of Lorraine, immovable
in the front rank, shamed them by his
example; they rallied; the guns, already
nearly captured, were saved;
the battle continued with greater
fierceness than before, and ceased
only with darkness. Daybreak was
the signal for its resumption, and at
last the Swiss were defeated. After
breaking their battalions, Guise, over
eager in pursuit, and already twice
wounded, had his horse killed under
him, was surrounded, overmatched,
and left for dead, with twenty-two
wounds. Nor would these have been
all, but for the devotedness of an
esquire, whose name Brantôme has
handed down as a model of fidelity.
Adam Fouvert of Nuremberg threw
himself on his master's body, and was
slain, serving as his shield. After the
action, Guise was dragged out from
amongst the dead, and conveyed by a
Scottish gentleman to the tent of the
Duke of Lorraine. He was scarcely
recognisable, by reason of his wounds;
he gave no sign of life, and his recovery
was deemed hopeless. He did
recover, however, thanks to great
care, and still more to the vigorous
constitution and energetic vitality
which distinguished all of his house,
and without which the career of most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of them would have been very short.
Scarcely one of the prominent members
of that family but received, in the
martial ardour of his youth, wounds
whose severity made their cure resemble
a miracle. A month after the
battle of Marignano, Guise, although
still suffering, was able to accompany
Francis I. on his triumphant entry
into Milan, "as captain-general of
the lansquenets, with four lieutenants,
all dressed in cloth of gold and white
velvet." One of his arms was in a
scarf, one of his thighs had to be supported
by an esquire, but still, by his
manly beauty and martial fame, he
attracted the admiring gaze of both
army and people. Francis, in his report
to his mother of the battle, named
Guise amongst the bravest, as well he
might; and thenceforward his great
esteem for the young hero was testified
in various ways&mdash;amongst others,
by intrusting to him several important
and delicate diplomatic missions.
At Bologna, on occasion of the interview
between Francis and Leo X., the
Pope addressed to Guise the most
flattering eulogiums. "Your holiness,"
replied the ardent soldier, in a
prophetic spirit, "shall see that I am
of Lorraine, if ever I have the happiness
to draw sword in the Church's
quarrel."</p>

<p>Master of the Milanese, Francis I.
returned to France and beheld his alliance
courted by all the powers of
Europe, when suddenly the death of
the Emperor Maximilian (15th January
1519) proved a brand of discord.
Francis and Charles were the only
serious candidates for the vacant dignity.
Guise, with a secret view, perhaps,
to the crown of Jerusalem for
himself, strained every nerve, exerted
all his influence, on behalf of
the French King. But Charles, the
more skilful intriguer, prevailed; and
Francis, deeply wounded and humiliated
by his failure, revolved in his
mind projects of war. In these the
king did not lose sight of the great
assistance he might expect from
Guise, brave, skilful, and prudent as
he was; and the esteem in which the
young chief was held at court increased
so greatly, that the French
nobles came to consider him almost
the equal of the members of the royal
family. Guise, on the other hand,
by reason of his enormous fortune and
high birth, and in his quality of a foreign
prince, spared no effort to place
himself on the footing of an ally rather
than of a subject of the King of France.</p>

<p>Pretexts for hostilities were not
wanting; and soon we find Guise, at
the head of his lansquenets, fighting
victoriously over the very same ground
upon which, in our day, French armies
contended with very different
results. Maya, Fontarabia, and the
banks of the Bidassoa witnessed his
prowess; he himself, a half-pike in
his hand, led his men through the
river, with water to his armpits, dislodging
the enemy by the mere terror
his audacity inspired. When he returned
to Compiègne, where the court
then was, the King hurried forth from
his chamber to meet him, embraced
him warmly, and gaily said, "that it
was but fair he should go out to meet
his old friend, who, on his part, always
made such haste to meet and
revenge him on his enemies." His
summer triumphs in the Pyrenees
were followed by a winter campaign
in Picardy, where he succeeded in
preventing the junction of the English
and Imperialists, besides obtaining
some advantages over the former, and
harassing their retreat to the coast.
He thus added to his popularity with
the army, and acquired strong claims
to the gratitude of the Parisians,
deeply alarmed by the proximity of
the enemy to the capital, and who
viewed him as their saviour.</p>

<p>The year 1523 opened under menacing
auspices. Germany, Italy,
England, were leagued against France,
whose sole allies were Scotland, the
Swiss, (the adhesion of these depending
entirely on regular subsidies,) and
the Duke of Savoy, whose chief merit
was that he could facilitate the passage
of the Alps. Undeterred, almost
foolhardy, Francis, instead of prudently
standing on the defensive, beheld,
in each new opponent, only a
fresh source of glory. Unhappily for
him, at the very moment he had
greatest need of skilful captains, the
Constable of Bourbon, irritated and
persecuted in France, courted and
seduced by the astute Charles V.,
entered into a treasonable combination
with the Imperialists. It was discovered;
he fled, and effected his escape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Out of France, he was but one man
the less, but that man was such a
leader as could hardly be replaced,
and Charles gave him command of his
troops in the Milanese. The Constable's
misconduct brought disfavour
on the princes of the house of Bourbon,
(of that of Valois none remained,)
and this further increased the credit
and importance of the Count of Guise.
He was already governor of Champagne
and Burgundy, provinces the
Emperor was likely to attack. This
command, however, was not the object
of his desires; he would rather
have gone to Italy, and applied to do
so; but the King, rendered suspicious
by the Constable's defection, began to
consider, with some slight uneasiness,
the position acquired by the Count of
Guise; and it was probably on this
account only that he would not confer
on the Lorraine prince the direction
of the Italian war. The glory of
Guise lost nothing by the refusal,
although that of France grievously
suffered by the army of Italy being
confided to the less capable hands of
Admiral Bonnivet. Fortune soon
afforded the younger general one of
those opportunities of high distinction,
of which no leader ever was more
covetous or better knew how to take
advantage. A large body of Imperialist
infantry having made an irruption into
Burgundy, he assembled the nobility of
the province and about nine hundred
men-at-arms, with which force he
deemed himself able to keep the field
against the twelve thousand lansquenets
that Count Furstemberg led to
meet him. By an odd accident, he had
no infantry, his adversary no cavalry.
By dividing his horsemen into small
parties, and maintaining an incessant
harassing warfare, Guise prevented the
Germans from foraging; and at last,
compelled by famine, they prepared
to recross the Meuse, abandoning two
forts they had captured, and carrying
off a large amount of spoil. Thus encumbered,
and vigorously pursued,
their rearguard was cut to pieces, and
their retreat converted into a rout.
"With a feeling of chivalrous gallantry,"
says M. de Bouillé, "Guise
desired to procure the duchess his
sister-in-law, Antoinette de Bourbon,
and the ladies of the court of Lorraine,
then assembled at Neufchâteau,
the enjoyment of this spectacle, (the
battle), to them so new. Warned by
him, and stationed at windows, out of
reach of danger, whence they looked
out upon the plain, they had the pastime,
and were able to recompense, by
their applause and cries of joy, the
courage of the troops whom their
presence animated."</p>

<p>But such partial successes, however
glorious to him by whom they
were achieved, were all insufficient to
turn the tide of disaster that had set
in against the French arms. The
defeat of Bonnivet, the invasion of
Provence by the Constable, were
succeeded by that terrible day before
the walls of Pavia, when Francis I.,
vanquished, wounded, made prisoner
by a rebellious subject, beheld his army
destroyed, and the battle-field strewn
with the bodies of his best generals,
whilst, bleeding at his feet, slain in
his defence, lay Francis of Lorraine,
a younger brother of the Count of
Guise, the second of that brave
brotherhood who had fallen in arms
under the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleur-de-lis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> When the
brave but most imprudent monarch
was carried into captivity, his mother,
regent in his absence, placed her
chief trust and dependence in Guise.
Of these he proved himself worthy.
He checked the ambition of the Duke
of Vendôme, who, as first prince of
the blood, showed a disposition to
seize upon the regency; he advised
the ransoming of the French prisoners
taken at Pavia, and exercised altogether
a most salutary influence upon
the circumstances of that critical time.
His good sword, as well as his precocious
wisdom, was soon in request.
A large body of German fanatics,
proclaiming the doctrine of absolute
equality, and the abolition of all
human superiority, had swept over
Suabia, Wurtemberg, and Franconia,
burning churches and slaying priests,
and threatened to carry the like
excesses into Lorraine and Burgundy.
By aid of his brothers, at much
expense and with great difficulty,
Guise got together ten thousand men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
four thousand of whom were cavalry.
The double cross was the rallying
sign of this little army. The time
was come for Guise to perform his
promise to Pope Leo, to fight stoutly
in defence of the Church. And truly
his hand was heavy upon the unfortunate
and half frantic Lutherans,
although to a certain extent he
tempered its weight with mercy.
Besieged in Saverne, the fanatics
put to death the herald who summoned
them to surrender. Learning
that reinforcements from Germany
were at hand, Guise hurried to meet
them with three thousand men, and
encountered them at the village of
Lupstein, into which the Germans
retreated, after a terrible conflict
outside the place, and threw up a
barricade as best they could, of carts,
casks, and gabions. From the cover
of these, and of the adjacent hedges,
they kept up so obstinate a defence,
that Guise, whose men fell fast,
caused fire to be applied to the
houses. But hardly had the flames
begun their ravages, when the Count,
seized with compassion, threw himself
from his horse to assist in extinguishing
them, and succeeded, at
imminent risk to his own life, in
saving upwards of four thousand
persons of all ages. Nearly double
that number perished; as many more
at Saverne and in the mountains, to
which the unfortunate Germans fled;
and about fifteen thousand in a final
engagement at Chenouville, which
broke the strength of the fanatic host,
and finally closed the campaign.
During one of these battles, the
soldiers of Guise beheld in the air
the image of the Saviour attached to
the cross, a phenomenon in which
they saw assurance of victory.</p>

<p>"Once more," says M. de Bouillé,
"Guise had rendered a most important
service to the kingdom; he
had also assumed a peculiar and
marked position, and had fixed a
point of departure for himself and his
descendants, by striking, of his own
accord, and without instructions from
the Government, the first blows that
Protestantism received in France:
a circumstance often recalled, with
more or less exultation, by the panegyrists
of that family, and which
procured Claude de Lorraine the
nickname of the <em>Great Butcher</em>, given
him by the heretics, who were exasperated
by the loss of nearly forty
thousand men, caused them by his
arms in that fatal expedition."</p>

<p>Determined foes to the Reformed
faith as both of them were, a distinction
must yet be made between the
Count of Guise assailing and slaughtering,
with far inferior forces, a formidable
body of armed and aggressive
foreigners, and the fierce <em>Balafré</em>,
wielding a murderous sword against
his defenceless and inoffensive Huguenot
countrymen, on the terrible night
of St Bartholomew. If the amount
of bloodshed at Saverne and Chenouville
appears excessive, and implies
that little quarter was given, it must yet
be remembered that greater clemency
to the vanquished might have had
the most disastrous consequences to
the handful of conquerors. The
Council of Regency disapproved of
Guise's conduct in the affair; taxing
him with rashness in risking the
whole of the small number of regular
troops disposable for the defence of
the kingdom. But there could hardly
have been more pressing occasion to
expose them; and Francis I., on
returning from exile, recognised and
rewarded that and other good services
by elevating the county of Guise into
a duchy and peerage&mdash;further enriching
the newly-made duke with a
portion of the crown domains. Such
honours and advantages had previously
been almost exclusively reserved
for persons of the blood-royal.
The Parliament remonstrated in vain;
but Francis himself, before very long,
repented what he had done. He took
umbrage at the increasing popularity
of the Duke of Guise, and gave ear
to the calumnies and insinuations of
the French nobles, who were irritated
by the haughty bearing, great prosperity,
and ambitious views of the
house of Lorraine. The manner in
which Francis testified his jealousy
and distrust was unworthy of a
monarch who has left a great name
in history. He showed himself indulgent
to those of his courtiers and
officers who organised resistance to
the influence and pretensions of the
Guises. "One time, amongst others,"
says M. de Bouillé, "the Duke of
Guise, governor of Burgundy, wishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to visit the castle of Auxonne,
whose governorship was a charge
distinct from that of the province,
the titulary, Rouvray, a French
gentleman, refused him admittance,
which he would not have dared to do
had Guise been recognised as prince.
When the Duke complained of this
treatment, the King, delighted, whilst
taking advantage of his services, to
see his pride and ambition thwarted,
lauded the conduct of Rouvray, and
laughed at him who had wished to play
the prince of royal blood." For annoyances
of this kind Guise sought compensation
in popularity, thus tracing
out for his descendants the line they
should most advantageously follow.</p>

<p>The partial disfavour into which
the Guises had fallen, during an interval
of peace when their services were
not indispensable, was dissipated by
the zeal and talents exhibited by the
Duke's brother, John Cardinal of
Lorraine, in a most difficult and
delicate negotiation with Charles V.,
and by the prompt good-will with
which, when negotiation failed and
war broke out, the Duke hurried to
the relief of Peronne, accompanied by
his eldest son, the Count of Aumale,
then scarcely nineteen years old.
Peronne la Pucelle was hard beset
by the Count of Nassau, who pounded
its ramparts with seventy-two
pieces of cannon, and was defended
with equal valour by Fleuranges,
Marshal de la Marck, who repulsed
an assault made simultaneously by
two breaches, and destroyed a mine
on which the enemy reckoned for
his discomfiture. Want of supplies,
and especially of powder, must soon,
however, have compelled him to
yield, but for a stratagem practised
by Guise. That able commander
selected four hundred resolute soldiers,
loaded each of them with a
bag containing ten pounds of powder,
and set out, at six in the evening,
from his headquarters at Ham, with
the Count of Aumale, whose first
experience of war this was, and to
whom Guise, as he wrote to the
King, "intended soon to give up his
sword, as capable of doing better
service in his young hands than in
his own." Two hundred horsemen
escorted them as far as the edge of
the marshes of Peronne, and at
midnight Guise, who had brought
with him a large number of drummers
and trumpeters, distributed these at
different points around the besiegers'
camp. Whilst they sounded and beat
the charge, and the Imperialist generals,
believing themselves attacked on
all sides, hastily formed their troops
for the combat, the powder-bearers,
guided by a soldier of the garrison
who had borne news of its distress
from Fleuranges to Guise, crossed the
marshes by means of a number of
little roads and bridges, which the
enemy himself had made to maintain
his communications, and reached the
moat, whence by means of ropes and
ladders they entered the fortress. The
last of them were just getting in when
day broke, and the Count of Nassau
discovered the trick that had been
played him, and detached a body of
cavalry to pursue Guise, then retreating
with his drums and trumpets, and
whose steady array discouraged attack.
A few days later the Imperialists
raised the siege, and Paris, which
had been in consternation at the
danger of Peronne, its last bulwark
against the advancing foe, knew no
bounds in its gratitude to the man to
whom it thus, for the second time,
was indebted for its salvation.
Guise's great services in this and
the following campaign rendered
Francis I. indulgent to his still-recurring
pretensions; to the arrogance
which led him frequently to
refuse obeying orders that did not
emanate directly from the King, and
to assume a sort of independence and
irresponsibility in the exercise of his
government. Looking back, through
the clarifying medium of history, upon
the character and conduct of Claude
of Lorraine, we are disinclined to
think that Francis had ever serious
cause for mistrusting the loyalty of
his powerful subject; whose encroachments,
however, it cannot be denied,
were sufficient grounds for jealousy
and uneasiness. And on more than
one occasion we find the royal anger&mdash;perhaps
complete disgrace&mdash;averted
from him only by the interest of his
brother the Cardinal, to whom Francis
could refuse nothing.</p>

<p>As a diplomatist and patron of the
arts, Cardinal John of Lorraine occupies
almost as elevated a pedestal in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the gallery of distinguished Frenchmen
of the sixteenth century, as does
his brother Claude in his more active
capacity of general of armies and
administrator of provinces. His
courtly qualities, and a congeniality
of tastes&mdash;some of which, although
they might be held excusable in a
king, were scarcely to be palliated in
a prelate, even in that age of lax morality&mdash;endeared
him to Francis, who
associated with him on a footing of
great familiarity. His generosity and
charity were on such a scale as at
times to resemble prodigality and
ostentation; his love of pleasure and
addiction to gallantry were in like
manner excessive. "He was," says
M. de Bouillé, "a very lettered prince,
a splendid patron of learned men,
whom he treated as friends, and in
whose labours he associated himself.
A writer named Bertrand de Vaux,
having presented and read to him a
critical work, containing low personality,
awaited, notwithstanding its
base character, the recompense which
the Cardinal always granted to those
authors with whose productions he
was satisfied. The prelate accordingly
handed him a golden etui. 'Take
this, friend Bertrand,' he said; 'it is
to pay the fatigue and salary of the
reader. The writer must seek payment
from some more malignant man
than myself.'" The celebrated Erasmus,
Clement Marot the poet, and
Rabelais the satirist, all benefited by
the patronage or enjoyed the intimacy
of the Cardinal, who, conjointly with
his nephew the Cardinal Charles of
Lorraine, is believed by some to have
been indicated by the witty priest of
Meudon in the character of Panurge.
Passionately fond of art, the prelate-prince
gathered around him the men
of genius whom the largesses and magnificence
of Francis I. seduced from
Italy to France. He showed particular
favour to Benvenuto Cellini, who
presented him with some of his works
and received from him costly gifts.
"When in full blaze of fortune and
favour, he caused to be built and
decorated, with blind prodigality,
after the designs of Primaticcio and
by the pupils of that famous artist,
the superb chateau of Meudon, in
whose park was constructed, amongst
other costly ornaments, a grotto,
'excellently fine and pleasant to save
oneself from being wetted by the rain.'
He had musicians in his service, and
Arcadelt, a distinguished composer,
some of whose works are still preserved
and esteemed, was his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître de
chapelle</i>." His charity, although often
too indiscriminate, sprang from real
kindness of heart. Numerous children,
belonging to poor families, were educated
at his expense in the Paris
schools. And his good grace in conferring
favours doubled their value.
The farmer of his abbey of Fécamp,
having made the same receipt serve
for three separate payments, and endeavouring
to make it pass a fourth
time, the Cardinal's receivers refused
to admit it, and the case was referred
to the prelate himself, who, having
examined and recognised his signature,
merely said, "Since John is
there, John shall be believed," and
ordered it to be definitively admitted.
When he went abroad, "he usually,"
says Brantôme, "carried a great
pouch, which his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet-de-chambre</i>,
who had charge of the money for his
petty expenses, failed not to fill each
morning with three or four hundred
crowns: and as many poor as he met
he put his hand into the pouch and
gave, without stint or consideration,
whatever he drew forth." The story
is well known of the blind mendicant,
who, having implored an alms of him
in the streets of Rome, exclaimed, on
receiving a handful of gold: "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">O tu
sei Christo, o veramente il cardinal di
Loriena</i>." By the light which these
details throw upon his character, it is
not difficult to discern that the magnificent
cardinal must have been a
welcome courtier to the sumptuous
Francis, who, during the period of his
favour, made him his constant companion
and delighted to do him honour.
He sat upon the King's left hand on
occasion of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lit de justice</i> held at
Paris on New Year's day 1537, at
which Francis declared Charles of
Austria attainted of rebellion and
felony, and deprived of Artois, Flanders,
and all the domains that he held
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en mouvance</i> of the crown of France&mdash;a
sentence more easily pronounced
than enforced, and which of course
entailed a war. Peace again concluded,
in great measure by the diplomacy
of the Cardinal, he it was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
according to Du Bellay, who alone
accompanied the King and Queen at
dinner, on the day of Charles V.'s
entrance into Paris. The friendship
borne him by Francis, was the cause
of his being charged to break to that
monarch the death of his son, the
Dauphin of France. Of the familiarity
with which the King treated him, M.
de Bouillé gives a specimen in a
curious anecdote: "One day, at mass,
the Cardinal did not perceive that a
thief, who had managed to enter the
chapel, had picked his pocket. The
rogue, observing that the King had
his eyes fixed upon him, with extraordinary
coolness and audacity put
his finger on his lips, looking at the
same time significantly at Francis I.,
who took the hint and said nothing,
in order not to spoil what he imagined
to be an adroit practical joke. Service
over, however, he made an observation
which induced the Cardinal to put
his hand in his pocket, when he discovered
his loss. When the King had
amused himself at his surprise, he
ordered that what had been stolen
should be restored; but the thief, who
was perfectly serious in his intentions,
had made his escape, which greatly
increased the mirth of the monarch,
thus cleverly duped. 'On the word
of a gentleman,' he exclaimed, 'the
rogue has made me his accomplice!'"</p>

<p>Powerfully supported at court by
his brother, Claude of Lorraine was
no less ably seconded in the field by
his son Francis, Count of Aumale, a
young hero destined ultimately to
surpass even him in glory, and to raise
the name of Guise to its apogee of
splendour. The constantly-recurring
wars with the Emperor yielded him
abundant opportunities to display
his prowess. In the campaign of
1543 he did good service, until, at
the siege of Luxemburg, he was
dangerously wounded above the ankle
by an arquebuse ball. "Carried,
almost without hopes&mdash;on account of
the fracture of the bones and the injury
to the nerves&mdash;first to his tent
and then to Longwy, five leagues in
rear, he owed his recovery to the
attention of the King, who sent him
his own physicians, and to the care
bestowed upon him by his father.
And nevertheless, when he suffered
signs of pain to escape him during the
dressing, the Duke of Guise addressed
to him reproaches by which it will be
seen that he subsequently profited,
saying to him&mdash;a noble and stoical
maxim&mdash;'That persons of his rank
ought not to feel their wounds, but, on
the contrary, to take pleasure in building
up their reputation on the ruin of
their bodies.'" It was in no feather-bed
school that the Guises were educated.
Nearly at the same time that the Count
d'Aumale was hit before Luxemburg,
Gaspard de Coligny-Châtillon, then
his rival in valour, and at a subsequent
day his deadly foe, was severely
wounded in the throat at the siege of
Binche.</p>

<p>In the war in which these incidents
occurred, England was allied with the
Emperor against France. Personal
motives combined with political irritation
to dispose the violent and
uxorious Henry VIII. to a rupture
with Francis I. Mary of Lorraine,
daughter of the Duke of Guise, and
widow of Louis of Orleans, duke of
Longueville, had been given in marriage
to James V. of Scotland, in
preference to Henry, who, inflamed
by the report of her beauty, had
solicited her hand as a pledge of perpetual
alliance with France. Dazzling
as was the offer of so powerful a
sovereign, his anti-catholic acts, and
his evil reputation as a husband, deterred
the Guises from entertaining it;
and Francis I., obeying the dictates
of feeling rather than those of prudence,
extricated them from a dilemma
by alleging a previous promise to the
Scottish king. It is said that Henry
would then gladly have espoused
Louisa, second daughter of the Duke,
and that, means being found to elude
his pursuit, this second disappointment
further augmented his rancorous feelings
towards Francis and the house of
Guise. However this may have been,
the war with England continued subsequently
to the conclusion of peace
between Francis and Charles&mdash;chiefly
in Picardy, around Boulogne, which
Henry held, and in whose neighbourhood
his army was encamped. Some
severe skirmishes and partial engagements
occurred, and in one of these
the Count of Aumale received a
wound, probably the severest ever
survived by mortal man, from the
lance of an English officer. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
weapon, according to the description
of Ambrose Paré, entered "above the
right eye, declining towards the nose,
and piercing through on the other
side, between the nape and the ear."
So violent was the blow that the
weapon broke in the head, into which
it had penetrated more than half a
foot, the entire lance-iron and two
fingers' breadth of the staff remaining
in the wound. Paré explains the
possibility of such a wound, in an age
when helmets and visors were in use,
by mentioning that the Count always
went into action with his face bare.</p>

<p>"Terrible as was the shock," says
M. de Bouillé, "it did not unhorse
d'Aumale. He still made head against
his foes, succeeded in forcing a passage
through them, aided by his young and
valiant brother Claude, and by de
Vieilleville&mdash;who, alone of all, had
not abandoned him&mdash;and rode gloriously
into camp. His appearance
was frightful; his face, armour, and
clothes were deluged with blood. The
surgeons, stupified by the depth and
gravity of the wound, despaired of
cure, and refused to inflict useless
sufferings upon the patient. But
Ambrose Paré, the King's surgeon,
sent by Francis with orders to try
every means of saving the hero's life,
was not discouraged. Confiding in
his skill, and in the firmness of the
wounded man, he resolved to attempt
an operation, terrible indeed, but
admirable for those days, and worthy
alone to insure celebrity to him who
imagined it. The lance-head was
broken off so short, that it was impossible
to grasp it with the hand. Taking
then a blacksmith's pincers, to
draw it out with great force, and
assisted, amongst others, by Master
Nicolle Lavernan, a very experienced
surgeon, he asked the Lorraine prince,
in presence of a crowd of officers shuddering
with horror, if he would submit
to the employment of such means,
and would suffer him to place his foot
upon his face. 'I consent to everything;
proceed,' replied d'Aumale.
Nor did his fortitude abandon him for
an instant during this cruel operation,
which was not effected without fracture
of bones, nerves, veins, and
arteries, and other parts, and which
he endured as if they had only pulled
out a hair. The agony extorted from
him but the single exclamation&mdash;'Ah!
my God!' Transported afterwards in
a litter to Pecquigny, he remained for
three days in a hopeless state: early
on the fifth day more favourable
symptoms declared themselves, and
nature made such powerful efforts,
that the cure was completed without
leaving the Count d'Aumale any trace
of this astonishing wound, except a
scar, equally glorious for him and for
Ambrose Paré. That skilful surgeon
was wont modestly to say, when
speaking of the marvellous cure of
Francis of Lorraine&mdash;'I dressed it,
and God healed it.' As soon as he
began to get better, the Count d'Aumale
hastened to write to the King,
with a hand still unsteady, the following
note, characterised by a calmness
remarkable in such circumstances:&mdash;'Sire,
I take the liberty to inform you
that I find myself well, hoping not to
lose an eye. Your very humble
servant, <span class="smcap">Le Guizard</span>.'" Admiring
his energy, and in recompense of his
services, Francis I. made him governor
of Dauphiny; whilst the numerous
partisans of the house of Guise
attributed his cure to a miracle
wrought by the prayers of his pious
mother, Antoinette of Bourbon. This
princess carefully preserved till her
death the lance-point which had penetrated
her son's head. The extent of
the wound, as described by Paré,
would be scarcely credible, but for the
testimony of that learned and excellent
man, and of other cotemporary
writers quoted by M. de Bouillé. In
a short time the heroic Count had forgotten
his hurt, and was again in arms
against the English, with whom, however,
peace was shortly afterwards
concluded.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the frequent uneasiness
occasioned him by the power
and ambition of the family of Guise,
Francis I. continued, almost to the
close of his reign, to enrich and aggrandise
them. The magnitude of
their services, and their many great
qualities, at intervals elicited his gratitude
and generosity, to the oblivion
of mistrust and apprehension. Thus,
only three years prior to his death,
he erected into a marquisate certain
lands and lordships of the Duke
of Guise, and immediately afterwards
elevated the marquisate to a duchy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in consideration, said the letters
patent, of the great, virtuous, and
commendable services that the Duke
of Guise had long rendered to king
and country, without sparing his own
person, his children, or goods; "and
also that our said cousin Duke of
Guise is of the house of Lorraine,
descended by wife and alliance from
the house of Anjou, and from our predecessors,
kings of France." Thus
was the title of Duke of Mayenne provided
for a younger son of Claude of
Lorraine. Such laudatory declarations
as the one above cited were
concurrent, however, with the systematic
restriction of the Guises' direct
influence on state affairs. And on his
deathbed, when dividing his last
hours upon earth between religious
duties and sage counsels to his son,
Francis enjoined this prince not to
recall the Constable of Montmorency,
or to admit to a share of government
the princes of the house of Guise.
Montmorency had incurred disgrace
and banishment by exciting the King's
conjugal jealousy. Henry II. showed
slight regard to his father's dying
injunctions. Scarcely had the earth
closed over the deceased monarch,
when those he had recommended to
his son's favour were removed from
their posts; Montmorency was recalled,
and the Guises were taken into
favour; the Count of Aumale, and
Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine, dividing
between them Henry's whole confidence.
It must be admitted, that the
means to which they resorted to
secure and preserve this favour, were
not of the most delicate description,
although, doubtless, they would be
very differently estimated then and
now. They sustained their credit
with Henry II. by their attentions to
Diana of Poitiers, his all-powerful
mistress, whose eldest daughter one
of the brothers, Claude, Marquis of
Mayenne, had just married. From
this discreditable alliance Châtillon,
afterwards the Admiral de Coligny,
had tried to dissuade them, by pointing
out, says Brantôme, in his Life of
the Admiral, "that it was not very
honourable for them, and that an inch
of authority and favour with honour
was better than an armful without."
The Count of Aumale, up to that
time the inseparable companion of
Coligny, was but ill-pleased by the
freedom of this advice, which, he
said, was less that of a friend than of
one envious of the good fortune such
an alliance insured to his family. This
difference, however, cast but a slight
cloud over the intimacy which thereafter
was exchanged for so bitter an
enmity. Meanwhile the royal favour,
lavished on the young Guises,
was not extended to their father, who
was excluded from the government
which his sons freely exercised, and
who, immediately after the coronation
of Henry, left the court, to live in
retirement in his castle of Joinville.
The prudence and moderation of the
elder Guise were probably less welcome
to the young king than the
bolder and more impetuous counsels
of his sons. There were six of these,
all pretty well provided for when
Claude of Lorraine retired into private
life: Francis, Count of Aumale;
Claude, Marquis of Mayenne; Charles,
Archbishop of Rheims; Louis, Bishop
of Troyes, and Francis, Chevalier of
Lorraine, afterwards grand-prior and
general of the galleys of France.
"During his stay at Paris, after the
campaign of 1544, the Duke of Guise
frequently went, accompanied by his
six young sons, to pay his devoirs to
the King, who always graciously received
and congratulated him, saying
'that he was six times fortunate in
seeing himself live again, before his
death, in a posterity of such great
promise.' One day Charles, the
second brother, who was intended for
the church, presented to Francis I.
some moral and theological theses,
accompanying them with an eloquent
and tasteful harangue. His promotion
to the archbishopric of Rheims,
the richest benefice in France, was,
it is said, the munificent reward of
this precocious ability." Henry II.
received his crown from the hands
of this youthful archbishop, upon
whom the Pope, five days after the
ceremony, conferred a cardinal's hat.
Charles of Lorraine can have been
but thirty or thirty-one years old,
when he thus attained to the highest
dignities of the church.</p>

<p>A few days before the coronation,
Henry II. sanctioned by his presence
the celebrated judicial duel&mdash;which
gave rise to a proverb still current in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
France&mdash;between Guy Chabot de
Jarnac, and François de Vivonne.
It took place in lists erected near the
chateau of St Germains. Vivonne's
second (or godfather, as it was then
called) was the Count of Aumale,
who attracted universal attention by
the grandeur of his air and the lustre
of his renown. "Towards half-past
seven in the morning," says M. de
Bouillé, "d'Aumale pronounced it
time to bring the arms, and the combatants
appeared in the lists, Vivonne
conducted by d'Aumale; and, after
the customary salutations and injunctions,
the king-at-arms, Normandy,
having thrice exclaimed&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Laissez aller
les bons combattants!</i> the combat
commenced with skill and fury. In
a few moments, however, by a blow,
since proverbial, dealt and repeated
on the left ham, Vivonne was prostrated
by his adversary. The Count
d'Aumale sprang to the assistance of
the vanquished man, and to calm the
rage which made him tear open his
own wounds. But Vivonne survived
only three days, and, after his death,
d'Aumale had the following inscription
engraved upon his tomb: 'A
great prince <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lorrain et François</i>, much
grieved and afflicted by so unexpected
an event, has dedicated this to the
manes of a brave knight of Poitou.'
In these few words was revealed a
pretension constantly entertained by
the house of Guise, and which then
appeared surprising, but which received
a sort of consecration from its
silent toleration by the King." It was
doubtless this toleration, combined
with the sentiment of growing power
and influence, which raised the arrogance
of the Guises to such a pitch
that, on occasion of Henry II.'s solemn
entrance into Chambery, during
a visit of inspection to his frontier
fortresses, we find the Count of Aumale
placing himself on the same
line with the Duke of Vendôme,
first prince of the blood, and afterwards
King of Navarre. The angry
dispute to which this gave rise was
terminated by the King, who maintained
Guise in the place he had
audaciously assumed. Like his father,
Henry was nurturing a pride which
was afterwards to give him umbrage.
Already d'Aumale's influence and
popularity were so great as to make
him courted by all classes, even to
the highest, not excluding persons of
blood-royal; and only a few months
after the dispute at Chambery, we
find the same King of Navarre thanking
him, conjointly with the Cardinal
of Bourbon, for services he had rendered
to friends of theirs. The first
nobles of the land had recourse to
his protection and support, and strove
to propitiate him by presents and
flattering letters. From all quarters
he received offerings of "wine, fruit,
confections, ortolans, horses, dogs,
hawks, and gerfalcons, the letters
accompanying these very often containing
a second paragraph, petitioning
for pensions or grants from the
King, or for places, even down to
that of apothecary, or of barber to
the Dauphin, &amp;c." The memoirs and
manuscripts of the time furnish many
curious particulars of this kind, especially
the MSS. Gaignières, often
referred to by M. de Bouillé. And
they further show that d'Aumale,
amidst his countless occupations,
found leisure to listen to all petitioners,
and means to content many.
There exist the most flattering letters
written to him by the hand of kings;
the humblest supplications addressed
to him by great state corporations, such
as the parliaments of Paris, Bordeaux,
and other cities; testimony of the
profoundest deference from the nobles
of the court&mdash;names such as Brézé
and Brissac being affixed to fulsome
protestations of service and
thanks for favour shown. Such was
the immense position of the Duke
d'Aumale, (that county also had
become a duchy,) who now openly
affected the state and quality of
prince of the blood. Then, as afterwards,
(when he was duke of Guise,)
he always received the title of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monseigneur</i>,
(except from the princes of
the blood, who called him <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</i>,)
and that of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vostre excellence or vostre
seigneurie</i>. And in 1548 the nuns of
Bonneuil addressed him a supplication
as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vostre haulte et puissante
majesté et seigneurie</i>. So great was
his reputation for magnanimity, so
popular his rule, that those provinces
rejoiced over which he was appointed
governor. And the affection borne
him by the French people became at
last so great "that it may be said it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
was carried to an excess, even to the
point of making them forget their
fidelity to the King." For a time the
favour and confidence of the King
kept pace with the love of the nation;
and it was augmented by the ability
with which d'Aumale pacified several
revolted provinces, where his presence
alone sufficed, for the most part, to
calm angry passions and revive the
loyalty of the population. Soon after
this expedition, occurred his marriage
with Anne d'Est, daughter of the
Duke of Ferrara, a beautiful, virtuous,
and well-dowered princess who
had been sought in marriage by
Sigismund, King of Poland, but
whom an innate sympathy for France,
combined with the able management
of Cardinal de Guise, induced to give
the preference to the Duke d'Aumale.</p>

<p>In his castle of Joinville, on the
12th April 1550, Claude, first duke of
Guise, piously and resignedly terminated
his illustrious and honourable
career. His duchess, Antoinette de
Bourbon, one of the most virtuous
and amiable princesses of her time,
his eldest son and the Marquis of
Elbeuf, were beside his dying bed;
and during his illness the King sent
frequent expresses to inquire his
state. His premature death, at the
age of fifty-three, after a short but
violent illness,&mdash;combined with some
solemn and generous expressions he
used a few minutes before breathing
his last, to the effect that he heartily
forgave the person, whosoever it
might be, who had given him "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le
morceau pour mourir</i>,"&mdash;gave rise to a
belief, further accredited by his funeral
oration and by the inscription on his
tomb, that he had perished by poison.
History has difficulty in confirming
this popular notion, in support of
which no evidence was ever produced,
nor anything beyond a vague supposition
that the author of the Duke's
death was a Genoese, an agent of the
Emperor, then in France to watch the
measures taken by that republic to
obtain from Henry II. means of
resistance to the party of Ferdinand,
in opposition to whom there was
little doubt that Guise would advise
the King to give his support to Genoa.
Considering, however, that Claude
of Lorraine lived away from court,
where his son had succeeded to his
influence, this is rather a far-fetched
story; and the probability is that the
Duke died of some unusual malady,
misunderstood by, perhaps wholly
unknown to, the imperfect medical
science of those days. But natural
deaths were rare in the house of
Guise; and in the sixteenth century
poison had no unimportant share in
the bills of mortality. Some indeed
have hinted its possible agency in the
death of John, Cardinal of Lorraine,
which occurred within forty days of
that of his brother Claude. This
prelate was on his way back from
Rome, where he had been an unsuccessful
aspirant to the papal tiara,
when he was suddenly informed, on
his passage through Lyons, of the
Duke's decease. It was possibly the
shock of this intelligence that brought
on an attack of apoplexy under which
he sank and shortly expired. "Providence,"
says M. de Bouillé, "had
perhaps resolved to consecrate, by an
almost simultaneous death, the union
which had so constantly and advantageously
existed between him and
his brother, and which the cotemporary
writers characterise, in their
mythological style, by comparing the
two princes to Castor and Pollux.
Their place was not to remain vacant,
but was about to be even more than
filled by two brothers, also 'the
happiest pair of brothers that ever
were seen;' one an accomplished
warrior and magnanimous hero, the
other a skilful and enterprising prelate,
who, by renewing the example
of a constant agreement of views, by
putting in practice that useful and
remarkable combination of the churchman
and the man of the sword, peculiar
to their family, and efficaciously
applied by them to politics and ambition,
realised an immense amount of
favour and authority. The first generation
of this dynasty&mdash;if not sovereign,
at least so brilliantly episodical&mdash;had
passed away, already almost surpassed
in grandeur by its successor, destined
to elevate itself in the inverse ratio of
the wearer of that crown which gradually
became almost illusory."</p>

<p>Certain it is that the figure of
Francis, second Duke of Guise, surnamed
the Great, occupies, upon the
canvass of French history, a far more
remarkable and important place than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
that of any one of the three kings
whose reigns were cotemporary with
his power. Early distinguished in
arms, his generosity, urbanity, and
irresistible valour made him the idol
of the army, whilst the prudence and
precocious wisdom he inherited from
his father, rendered him invaluable
at the council board, and secured him
the favour of his sovereign; to such
a point that Henry II. had no secrets
from him, but caused all important
despatches to be communicated to
him as punctually as they were to
himself. Nor was his brother Charles
inferior to him in talent, although
their difference of profession rendered
its display less striking in the cardinal.
Both possessed of admirable tact and
judgement in the conduct of public
affairs, the one was not more terrible
in the battle-field than the other was
skilful and seductive in diplomatic
negotiations, and in the graceful intercourse
of private life. The cardinal's
learning and eloquence, his fine countenance,
his dignified bearing, his
richly-stored memory, combined to
exercise a powerful fascination upon
all he met. "Had I the elegance of
Monsieur le Cardinal de Lorraine,"
said Theodore de Beze one day, when
mounting his horse to leave Rheims,
where he had had a conference with
the accomplished prelate, "I should
expect to convert half the persons in
France to the religion I profess."</p>

<p>At the date of the death of Claude
of Lorraine, Charles V. was the sole
survivor of the three remarkable
sovereigns who had simultaneously
filled the three most important European
thrones. With him the Duke
and Cardinal now impelled Henry II.
into a war, which had for its real
object the realisation of a bold and
extensive scheme greatly to increase
the authority of France in Europe,
and at the same time to establish the
omnipotence of the Guises in France.
One of the most remarkable events
of this war was the siege of Metz, in
which large ill-fortified place the
Duke, with a small number of men,
was exposed to the assaults of an
army consisting of one hundred thousand
infantry, twenty-three thousand
horse, and one hundred and twenty
pieces of artillery. Guise displayed
extraordinary skill and energy, leading
sorties himself, and even issuing
forth at the head of a mere handful of
men to skirmish with the enemy.
Fortunately he had had time to lay
in good store of provisions; but his
cannon were few in number and for
the most part unserviceable, and he
was fain to defend with falconets and
other small guns, the breaches which
the Imperialists soon made in his
walls. In an action that occurred
during the siege, in the neighbourhood
of Nancy, Claude de Guise&mdash;that
brother of the Duke who, when a mere
youth, had powerfully and valiantly
contributed to deliver him, in front of
Boulogne, from an overwhelming
number of assailants&mdash;was taken
prisoner. Thrice wounded, and with
his horse killed under him, he had no
choice but to yield or die. This disaster
deprived Metz of a gallant
defender, and plunged Guise and the
whole army into deep affliction; the
Duke, however, consoling himself by
the resolution to make the Emperor
dearly pay for his brother's ransom,
and by the reflection that d'Aumale
had not yielded until he was knocked
down and had a cocked pistol at his
throat. The sorties continued with great
vigour, but at the expense of many
wounded men, of whom so large a
proportion died, for want of efficient
medical assistance, that a rumour
gained credit that the drugs were
poisoned. Guise begged the King to
send him Ambrose Paré with a stock
of fresh medicaments, and, by the
connivance of an Italian officer in the
Imperialist camp, that skilful leech
was introduced at midnight into the
town, with the apothecary Daigue
and a horse-load of medical stores.
Paré was bearer of a letter from the
King, thanking Guise and the other
princes and nobles for all they had
done and were doing to preserve his
town of Metz, and assuring them he
would remember and reward their
services. Thus encouraged, and confident
in his troops, Guise wrote to
the King, with whom he found means
constantly to correspond in cypher,
that Metz could hold out six months
without succour. On the other hand
the Imperialists redoubled their efforts
for success. The Emperor, who lay
at Thionville, sick of the gout and
expectant of triumph, at last judged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
his presence indispensable for the
fortunate conclusion of the siege, and
made his appearance in the camp,
mounted on an Arab horse, "his face
very pale and wasted, his eyes sunken,
his head and beard white." His
coming was the signal for so great a
salvo of artillery and small arms, that
the besieged flew to arms, expecting
a general attack. Until the neighbouring
castle of La Horgne could be
prepared for his reception, he took up
his quarters in a small wooden house,
hastily constructed with the ruins of
an abbey. "A fine palace," he said,
"when I shall receive in it the keys
of Metz." But the keys were long in
coming, although the fierceness of the
attack was redoubled&mdash;fourteen thousand
cannon-shots being fired against
the ramparts in one day, the noise of
which was said to have been heard
beyond the Rhine, at forty leagues
from Metz. The constancy of the
besieged was a match for the fury of
the assailants. Breaches were diligently
repaired, and sorties continued&mdash;the
French actually seeking the
Imperialists under their tents. Suddenly
the latter changed the point of
attack, and directed their cannonade
against one of the very strongest parts
of the rampart, behind which the
besieged hastened to construct a
second wall, also of great strength.
The sudden change of plan is attributed
by Ambrose Paré in his <cite>Voyage
à Metz</cite>, to a stratagem employed by
Guise. The Duke, according to
the learned physician and chronicler,
wrote a letter to Henry II. with the
intention of its being intercepted by
the enemy, in which he said, that if
Charles V. persisted in his plan of
attack, he would be compelled to
raise the siege, but that a very different
result was to be apprehended, if
unfortunately the enemy directed his
attention to a certain point, cunningly
indicated in the despatch. Sewn,
with an affectation of mystery, under
the doublet of a clumsy peasant, this
letter was destined for the perusal of
the Duke of Alva, one of whose
patrols did not fail to seize and search
the unfortunate messenger, who was
forthwith hanged. Misled by the information
thus obtained, the besiegers
changed the position of their batteries.
In two days a breach was effected,
the old wall crumbling into the ditch,
amidst the acclamations of the assailants.
But their joy was exchanged
for rage and disgust when, upon the
subsidence of the dust, they beheld a
second wall in rear of the breach. The
French began to scoff and abuse them,
but Guise commanded silence, under
pain of death, lest some traitor should
take advantage of the tumult to convey
information to the enemy; whereupon
his soldiers fastened live cats to the
end of their pikes, whose discordant
cries mocked the enemy. The enthusiasm
of the besieged now knew no
bounds. Men, women, and young
girls toiled day and night to strengthen
the inner wall. Guise's gay and encouraging
words gave confidence to
all. Collecting his soldiers upon the
breach, which was ninety feet wide:
"I rejoice," he said, "that the enemy
have at last overthrown this barrier,
more useful to them than to you. You
have so often visited them in their
camp, that it is only just they should
have an opportunity of reconnoitring
the town upon whose capture they so
boastfully reckoned." Charles ordered
the assault; but when his troops
saw the French crowning the breach,
with Guise at their head, they recoiled
as if already attacked, and neither
entreaties nor threats could move
them forward. "How is it," the
Emperor had exclaimed with a great
oath, when he saw the gaping breach,
"that they do not enter? It is so
large and level with the ditch; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vertu
de Dieu!</i> what means this?" He
had himself conveyed in a litter to
the foremost ranks, to animate the
soldiers by his presence. When he
beheld their retreat, he mournfully
desired to be carried back to his quarters.
"Formerly," he said, "I was
followed to the fight, but I see that I
have now no men around me; I must
bid adieu to empire and immure myself
in a monastery; before three
years are over, I will turn Franciscan."
Finally, on the 26th December,
provisions running short, and
his army weakened one-third by sickness
and the sword, Charles, with a
sad heart, raised the siege, uttering,
in the bitterness of his shame and disappointment,
the well-known words,
"I plainly see that Fortune, like a
true woman, prefers a young king to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
an old emperor." The imperial
camp and artillery crossed the
Moselle, and in the night the Duke of
Alva evacuated his position, leaving
behind a quantity of stores and tents.
Guise, who had expressed, that very
evening, in a letter to his brother the
Cardinal, his conviction that the Emperor
would never endure the shame
of abandoning the siege, was greatly
astonished in the morning to find that
the enemy had decamped. His skill
and constancy had triumphed, and
France was saved from invasion.
When he reappeared at court, the
King embraced him with transport,
and called him his brother. "You
have vanquished me as well as the
Emperor," said Henry, "by the
obligations you have laid me under."</p>

<p>The Duke of Guise's humanity after
the siege did him as much honour
as his bravery during it. A large
number of sick men remained in the
Imperialist camp; the rearguard of
the retreating army were in a pitiable
state, and, unable to proceed, yielded
themselves ready prisoners. The
commander of a troop of Spanish
cavalry, pursued by the Prince of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la
Roche-sur-Yon</i>, who would fain have
brought him to battle, suddenly faced
about, exclaiming, "How should we
have strength to defend ourselves,
when you see we have not enough
left to fly?" In the hospitals of
Metz and Thionville, the sick and
wounded Imperialists were carefully
tended by order of Guise; non-combatant
prisoners were sent back to
the Duke of Alva, with the offer of
covered boats to transport his exhausted
soldiers; the bodies of the
dead received suitable burial. The
magnanimous general's courtesy and
humanity bore their fruits. In the
following campaign, when the town
of Therouenne, in Picardy, was surprised
by the Imperialists, the Germans
and Flemings were putting inhabitants
and garrison to the sword,
without distinction of age or sex,
when the Spanish officers, with a
lively and grateful remembrance of
the good treatment received from
Guise and the French, united their
voices and efforts to check the carnage.
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonne guerre, compagnons,</i>"
they cried; "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souvenez-vous de la courtoisie
de Metz!</i>"</p>

<p>It was during the following campaign
(1554) that there occurred the
first marked manifestations of discord
between the Duke of Guise and the
Admiral de Coligny. In the combat
of Renty, near St Omer, Coligny
commanded the infantry, in his quality
of colonel-general of that arm. Victory
declared itself for the French;
already many trophies had been taken,
and heavy loss inflicted on the Imperialists,
who were on the brink of a
general rout, when Guise "feeling"
says M. de Bouillé, "that he was
not supported by the Constable de
Montmorency&mdash;the retreat also, according
to a report current at the
time, having been sounded <em>by the
breath of envy</em>&mdash;was unable to follow
up his advantage, and could but
maintain himself on the field, whilst
the Imperialists, although defeated,
succeeded in entering the besieged
fort." The chief merit of this imperfect
victory was attributed by the
Constable to his nephew Coligny, who,
on his part, was said to have asserted
that, during the heat of the fight, Guise
had not been in his right place. This
led, upon the evening of the action,
to a violent altercation, which would
have ended with drawn swords but
for the intervention of the King, in
whose tent it occurred. He compelled
them to embrace; but the reconciliation
was only skin-deep, and from
that day forwards a rancorous dislike
was substituted for the close intimacy
which had existed in their youth between
these two great soldiers, and
which had been carried to such a
point that they "could not live without
each other, wearing the same
colours, and dressing in the same
manner." Henceforward they were
constant antagonists, the chiefs of two
parties under whose banners nobles,
soldiers, and courtiers ranged themselves,
according to the dictates of
their sympathies or interests. And
soon their rivalry for fame and influence
was inflamed and envenomed
by the ardour of religious passions,
and of combats for their respective
creeds.</p>

<p>It is here impossible to trace, even
in outline, the events that crowded
the reign of Henry II., and in which
the Duke, the Cardinal, and their brother
d'Aumale played a most conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
part. It was a constant succession
of battles and intrigues, for
the most part terminating, in spite of
formidable foes both in the field and
at court, to the advantage of the
Guises. And when, a few weeks
after the battle of St Quintin, so disastrous
to the French arms&mdash;where
the Constable de Montmorency, who
had boasted beforehand of victory,
beheld his entire army slain or taken,
and himself a prisoner&mdash;the Duke of
Guise returned from Italy, "to save
the state," as the King himself expressed
it, he found himself at the
utmost pinnacle of power a subject
could possibly attain. On the very
day of his arrival, Henry declared
him lieutenant-general of the French
armies, in and out of the kingdom;
a temporary dignity, it is true, but
one superior to that of Constable, and
which usually was bestowed only in
times of regency and minority. That
nothing should be wanting to the
exorbitant authority thus conferred
upon the man to whom sovereign and
nation alike were wont to turn in the
day of danger and disaster, the King
addressed to all the provincial authorities
particular injunctions to obey
the orders of the Duke of Guise as
though they emanated from himself;
and truly it was remarked, says
Dauvigny in his <cite>Vies des Hommes
Illustres</cite>, that never had monarch in
France been obeyed more punctually
and with greater zeal. The whole
business of the country now rested
upon the shoulders of Guise. But
even whilst thus exalting him, Henry,
conscious of his own weakness, and
haunted, perhaps, by his father's
dying injunction, was actually plotting
how to lessen the power of his great
subject, so soon as the period of peril
should have passed, during which his
services were indispensable. With
strange infatuation, the feeble monarch
expected to be able to clip at
will the wings of that soaring influence,
when victory over the foreigner
and the liberation of the country
should have confirmed its domination.</p>

<p>Invested with his new dignities,
whose importance his sagacity fully
appreciated, Guise, with the least
possible delay, set out for Compiègne,
which, since the recent disasters of
the French arms, was a frontier town.
Those disasters, he felt, could be
effectually repaired only by a brilliant
feat of arms, at once useful to the
state, and flattering to the national
pride. Upon such a one he resolved.
Calais, now upwards of two centuries
in possession of the English, to the
great humiliation of France, was the
object of destined attack. Skilled in
the stratagems of war, the Duke contrived,
by a series of able man&oelig;uvres,
to avert suspicion of his real design,
until, on the 1st January 1558, he
suddenly appeared before the ramparts
of Calais. The siege that ensued has
been often narrated. It terminated,
after an obstinate resistance, in the
capitulation of the garrison, which
had scarcely been executed, when an
English fleet appeared off the port,
bearing succours that came too late.
The triumph excited indescribable
astonishment and joy throughout
France. It was a splendid revenge
for the defeat of St Quintin, and produced
a marked change in the sentiments
of several foreign potentates,
who believed that reverse to have
prostrated the French power for some
time to come. The Grand Signior
offered the co-operation of his fleet,
and the German princes hastened,
with redoubled good-will, the levies
that had been demanded of them.
Pope Paul IV., when congratulating
the French ambassador, pronounced
the highest eulogiums on Guise, and
declared the conquest of Calais preferable
to that of half England. At
court, the partisans of the Constable
were in dismay, and tried to lessen
the merit of the victor by attributing
its success to the adoption of a plan
sketched by Coligny. But even if
this were true, the merit of the execution
was all the Duke's own. Upon
the heels of this triumph, quickly followed
the capture of Guines and the
evacuation by the English of the
castle of Hames, their last possession
in the county of Oye. "In less
than a month," says M. de Bouillé,
"Francis of Lorraine had accomplished
the patriotic but difficult
enterprise so often and fruitlessly
attempted during two centuries, and
had cancelled the old proverb applied
in France, in those days, to generals
of slight merit, of whom it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
derisively said, 'He will never drive
the English out of France.'"</p>

<p>Henry II., accompanied by the
Dauphin, the Cardinals of Lorraine
and Guise, and several nobles of the
court, made a journey to Calais,
which he entered with great pomp.
The object of this expedition was to
sustain the courage and zeal of the
troops, who endured much fatigue
and hardship, in that inclement
season and in the midst of the
marshes. The King also wished to
testify his gratitude to his lieutenant-general,
showing him great confidence,
referring to him all who requested
audience on business, and presenting
him, in the most flattering terms,
with a house in Calais. The Duke
returned with Henry to Paris, where
great feasts and rejoicings were held
in his honour, and, on occasion of the
Dauphin's marriage with Mary Queen
of Scots, which shortly followed,
Guise filled, in the absence of Montmorency,
the office of grand-master,
which he long had coveted. Concurrently,
however, with this great
apparent favour, Henry was secretly
uneasy at the power and pretensions
of the family of Guise, and
maintained a constant and confidential
correspondence with their inveterate
enemy the Constable de Montmorency.
On the other hand the
Guises were on their guard, labouring
to countermine and defeat
the intrigues levelled against them.
Urged on by his brother, and feeling
that, in their position, if they did not
advance they must recede, the Duke
directed all his efforts to an effectual
concentration in his own hands of the
entire military power of the kingdom.
Should he fail in this, he at least was
resolved to leave none in those of his
rivals. By this time the progress of
the Reformed religion in France had
attracted great attention. It was an
abomination in the eyes of Henry;
and of this the Duke and Cardinal
took advantage to work the downfall
of d'Andelot, brother of Coligny, and
colonel-general of the French infantry,
the only military commander who at
that moment caused them any uneasiness.
Accused of heresy, and summoned
before the King, who received
him kindly, and, expecting he would so
reply as to disconcert his enemies,
"commanded him to declare, in presence
of all the court, his belief with
respect to the holy sacrifice of mass;
d'Andelot proudly replied that his
gratitude for the King's favours doubtless
rendered entire devotedness incumbent
upon him, but that his soul
belonged to God alone; that, enlightened
by the torch of Scripture, he
approved the doctrines of Calvin, and
considered mass a horrible profanation
and an abominable invention of
man." Furious at what he deemed a
blasphemy, the King, who was at
supper, snatched a basin from the
table and hurled it at d'Andelot; but
it struck the Dauphin. He was then
tempted, says one of his historians, to
pierce the offender with his sword, but
finally contented himself with sending
him to prison, and the post of colonel-general
was bestowed upon Montluc,
an ex-page of Guise's grandfather,
and a devoted partisan of the house
of Lorraine. This brave Gascon
officer at first scrupled to accept it, for
he feared to incur the hatred of the
Colignys and the Constable. Wily
and wary, like most of his countrymen,
he declared himself willing to
serve as a private soldier under the
Duke, but modestly declined the command
offered him. The King insisting,
he alleged a dysentery, as rendering
him incapable of the needful
activity. This and other objections
being overruled, he took possession of
his important command, and speedily
proved himself worthy to hold it&mdash;notably
at the siege of Thionville on
the Moselle. This fortress, one of the
strongest the Imperialists owned, was
defended by Jean de Caderebbe, a
brave gentleman of Brabant, at the
head of three thousand picked men.
The Dukes of Guise and Nevers, and
Marshal Strozzi, were the leaders of the
besieging army; Montluc joined them
on the eve of the opening of the batteries,
and did excellent service. On
the fifteenth day of the siege, Guise
was in the trenches, talking to Strozzi,
on whose shoulder his hand rested,
when the Marshal was struck by an
arquebuse ball, a little above the
heart. On feeling himself hit, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah!
tête Dieu, Monsieur</i>," exclaimed this
brave and able general, "the King
loses to-day a good servant, and your
Excellency also." He did himself no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
more than justice. Guise was deeply
affected, but, repressing his emotion,
he tried to fix Strozzi's thoughts on
religion. The veteran's death was
less exemplary than his life; he died
in profession of unbelief; and Guise,
much scandalised, but perhaps doubly
furious at the thought that the soul as
well as the body of his old comrade had
perished by the sudden manner of his
death, prosecuted the siege with fresh
ardour, eager for revenge, and suppressing
for the moment, as far as
he was able, the disastrous news,
which could not but produce a most
unfavourable impression. Valiantly
seconded by Montluc and Vieilleville,
on the 22d June, two days after
Strozzi's death, he received the capitulation
of the garrison. His triumph
was well earned. Besides the exhibition,
throughout the siege, of the
genius and inventive resource that
constitute a general of the highest
order, he had toiled and exposed himself
like a mere subaltern, constantly
under fire, personally superintending
the pioneers and artillerymen, and
rarely sleeping; so that it was no
wonder (considering he had not had
a single night's rest during the operations
against Thionville) that on the
1st July, when preparing for the siege
of the rich little town of Arlon, he
complained of being very drowsy, and
left Montluc to invest the place&mdash;himself
retiring to bed in a cottage, and
giving orders to let him sleep till he
awoke of himself. "It is very quick
work," he observed, crossing himself,
when he was the next day informed,
in reply to his inquiry whether the
batteries had opened fire, that Montluc
had surprised and taken the place
in the night.</p>

<p>Whilst Guise was thus not only rendering
great services himself, but
bringing forward leaders whose exploits
honoured the French arms, in
other quarters affairs went less
favourably for France. Near Dunkirk,
Marshal Thermes was beaten and
taken prisoner, and Guise, whose frequent
lot it was to repair the blunders
or misfortunes of less capable generals,
marched to Picardy; on the
frontier of which province, at a grand
review passed by Henry II., the
Duke's son and successor, Henry,
Prince of Joinville, then but eight
years old, appeared for the first time
in public, with his cousin, the Count
of St Vallier, son of the Duke
d'Aumale. Accompanied by their
preceptors and some other gentlemen,
and mounted on ponies, they rode
through the ranks, until they reached
the troops commanded by Montluc.
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cà, çà</i>, my little princes," exclaimed
that brave captain, "dismount;
for I was brought up in
the house of which you are issue,
which is the house of Lorraine, where
I was page, and I will be the first
to put arms in your hands." The
two cousins dismounted, and Montluc,
taking off the little silken <em>robons</em>
that covered their shoulders, placed
a pike in the hand of each of them.
"I hope," he said, "that God will
give you grace to resemble your
fathers, and that I shall have brought
you good fortune by being the first
to invest you with arms. To me
they have hitherto been favourable.
May God render you as brave as you
are handsome, and sons of very good
and generous fathers." After this
species of martial baptism, the two
children, conducted by Montluc,
passed along the front of the troops,
objects of the admiration and good
wishes of men and officers. A few
months later, one of them was dead;
the other, heir to most of the great
qualities, whether good or bad, that
distinguished his race, lived to prosecute,
and at one time almost to
realise, the most ambitious designs
his father and grandfather had conceived.
The fair-haired boy of the
review at Pierrepont, was the stern
<em>Balafré</em> of the wars of the League.</p>

<p>The spring of the year 1559 found
the Guises in marked disfavour with
the King. The great services of the
Duke, the capture of Calais and Thionville,
and the many other feats of
arms by which he had reduced the
power of the enemy, at moments when
it was about to be fatal to France,
were insufficient to counterbalance
the alarm felt by Henry II. at his
and the Cardinal's influence and ambition.
The star of the Constable
was in the ascendant. Chiefly by
his intervention, a disadvantageous
peace was concluded, and, at his request,
d'Andelot was recalled to
court. Montmorency and Coligny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
triumphed. The efforts of the Protestants
combined with court intrigues
to ruin the credit of the house
of Lorraine. The two brothers were
attacked on all sides, and in every
manner: epigram and satire furiously
assailed them, and they were denounced
as aspiring, one to the tiara,
the other to the crown of France.
However doubtful&mdash;or at least remote
from maturity&mdash;these projects were,
they were yet sufficiently probable for
their denunciation to produce the
desired effect on the mind of Henry,
already writhing impatiently under
the domination of the Guises, against
whom he was further prejudiced by
his mistress, the Duchess de Valentinois,
(Diane de Poitiers,) still influential,
in spite of her threescore winters.
Never had circumstances been
so menacing to the fortunes of the
Guises; and perhaps it was only the
subtle and temporising line of conduct
they adopted in this critical conjuncture,
that saved them from utter disgrace
and downfall. Things had
been but a short time in this state,
and already, from the skilful man&oelig;uvres
of the Cardinal, their side of
the balance acquired an upward inclination,
when the whole aspect of
affairs was changed by the death of
Henry II. With the reign of his
feeble successor, there commenced for
the restless princes of Lorraine a new
epoch of power and renown.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>MY PENINSULAR MEDAL.</h2>

<h3>BY AN OLD PENINSULAR.</h3>


<h4>PART VIII.&mdash;CHAPTER XIX.</h4>

<p>Now for the fight. On the morning
of the battle of Toulouse we left
Grenade. It was known amongst us
that the battle was coming off; and
we started in the expectation of passing
the night either in the city itself,
or in its immediate vicinity. We
ascended towards the city by the left
bank of the Garonne, but reached a
pontoon bridge, which enabled us to
cross to the right bank, where the
main body of our troops was posted.
The fight had commenced. We heard
the firing as we advanced; and while
we approached the scene of action, it
became gradually louder and more
distinct. Immediately in the rear of
the British lines we halted, not knowing
the ground, and withdrew from the
road into a field which was close at
hand, in order that our numerous
party might not prove an obstacle to
passing troops, ammunition, or artillery.
Our forces held the low ground,
and closed, in a sort of semicircle,
around the heights occupied by the
French. As it so happened that I
was not only at this battle, but in it,
I here beg leave to relate the circumstances
which led to my finding myself
in a position where, as a civilian,
I was so little wanted, and so much
out of my ordinary sphere of duty.</p>

<p>Sancho did it all. We were sitting
upon our nags, speculating upon the
fight, and seeing all that could be
seen, till we began to think we knew
something of what was going on. At
this moment rode up from the rear,
coming across the fields, an old officer
of rank, a major-general, well known
at headquarters, without aide-de-camp,
orderly, or any kind of attendant.
He inquired eagerly, "Where
are the troops?&mdash;Where are the
troops?" We pointed forward; little
was visible but trees. He looked
rather at a loss, but turned his horse's
head in the direction we had indicated.
That villain Sancho, seeing
another horse go on, snorted, and
pulled at the bridle. He was tired of
standing still. I, ever indulgent to
Sancho, followed the old general, and
soon overtook him. "I believe I
know the position of the troops, sir.
Will you give me leave to show
you?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, thank you," said
he; "I shall really be much obliged."</p>

<p>We rode on till we reached a British
regiment, drawn up in line. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
renewed acknowledgments he then
took his leave. The air was musical
above our heads with whistling and
humming missiles. I was now fairly
upon the ground, and didn't like to go
back.</p>

<p>There was a lull in the fight. The
spectacle was singular. Some firing
was kept up on both sides, but not
sufficient to obscure the view of the
French position, which rose immediately
in front, a bare range of hills,
crowned by their redoubts. The
atmosphere was bright; and though
the skirmishers on the declivity were
discoverable only by small white jets
of smoke, as they fired from time to
time, every movement of the enemy
on the summit, with the sky for its
background, was perfectly visible. I
noticed a single horseman, probably
an aide-de-camp bearing orders, as
distinct and diminutive as if seen
through the wrong end of a telescope.
You might perceive the very action of
his horse, that laborious up-and-down
gallop of the French manége, which
throws away so much of the animal's
strength, and sacrifices speed without
securing elegance.</p>

<p>The combat, at this moment, was
renewed, and our troops went to work
in earnest. The Spanish army
ascended the hill to assault the
enemy's redoubts. This movement,
at first, had all the regularity of a
review. But the redoubts opened
their fire; as the Spaniards moved
up, the smoke rolled down; and,
when the wind swept it away, their
broken bands were seen in precipitate
retreat, followed by a large body of
the French, who swarmed out from
their intrenchments. Instantly, and
just in front of me, our artillery
opened upon the pursuing foe. The
round-shot plumped into their columns,
knocking up clods as high as a
house; and the enemy, not relishing
this salutation, hastily fell back to
their former position. Sancho now
became a dreadful plague. He had
for some time been getting unquiet,
and, with the continual firing, he
grew worse and worse. I believe
this was his first battle, as it was
mine. Not content with a little extra
restiveness at every fresh discharge of
artillery, he had worked himself into
a state of chronic excitement, and,
at intervals, attempted to bolt. It
was clear I must get rid of Sancho,
or see no more of the fight; so I
deposited him in a stable, under care
of a cottager, in the adjoining village.</p>

<p>Still moving towards the left, along
the base of the hill, I reached a part
of the British position, where a number
of our troops were waiting to
storm the heights, when the flank
movement against the enemy's right,
which was his weakest point, should
be sufficiently advanced. All at once
I plumped upon "Cousin Tom," whom
I had not met since he embarked, three
years before, a raw subaltern, at Portsmouth.
There he now stood, as large
as life, rough and ugly, at the head of
his regiment, a regular "Old Peninsular;"
and on him had devolved the
duty, as he gave me to understand,
of "taking those fellows up the hill."
This service, I thought, would have
fallen to some officer of higher rank;
but Tom explained. The regiment
having been reduced, either by losses
or detachment, its numbers in the field
were small, and he, being the senior
officer present, of course had to
"carry them up." "Come," said he,
"we are going to take a look at those
monsieurs above there; you may as
well go with us."</p>

<p>The proposal was coolly made, so
I took it coolly. "With all my
heart," said I. "You know what is
the feeling towards an amateur. If
he makes an ass of himself, he's
laughed at; and if he gets hit, they
only say, it serves him right. If it's
of any use, I'll go with pleasure."</p>

<p>"Use?" said Tom; "the greatest
use. Why, I want to ask you twenty
questions about friends in England.
Besides, you know, if I am knocked
over, you can pick me up."</p>

<p>"Very well, then; and you can
do the same for me."</p>

<p>"No, no," said cousin Tom; "I
don't promise that. Got my men to
attend to. If I am hit, you must
take care of me. If you are hit, you
must take care of yoursel&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
that's the signal. Come along." Away
we went, up the hill.</p>

<p>Rank and file&mdash;double-quick time&mdash;a
capital pace for opening the
chest. Tom took it easy, trotting on
at a steady pace, and assailing me
with a running fire of questions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
while the row that had already commenced
above prevented my returning
categorical replies. "Is your
father at sea now?"&mdash;Bang! from
one of the big guns in the French
batteries right over our heads. "Got
any brandy?"&mdash;A shout from a thousand
throats, in the rush and shock
of a charge with bayonets. "Had
breakfast this morning?"&mdash;Pop!
pop! pop! a running fire of musketry.
Pop! pop! pop! "Got any
cigars?"&mdash;Bang! bang! the big guns
at it again. "When did you hear
from your mother?" A new sound,
less loud and sudden, but, from its
peculiarity, distinct amidst the din;
a spiteful, whirling, whizzing noise,
ten thousand skyrockets combined in
one; not, though, like the skyrocket,
first loud, then less audible&mdash;quite
the contrary. Commencing with a
faint and distant hiss, it grew louder
and louder, came singing on, nearer
and nearer, till a shell dropped a
few yards in front of our column!
The hiss was now an angry roar, like
the blowing off of steam. There lay
the bottled demon, full in our path,
threatening instant destruction, and
daring us to advance. Our column
halted. "Hurra! my lads," cried
Cousin Tom, waving his sword.
"Come along, old Five-and-threepennies.
Push by it at once, before
it <em>spreads</em>." The game old Five-and-threepennies
gave a shout&mdash;rushed
forward&mdash;got by in time; each yelping
and capering as he passed the
fizzing foe. Bang went the shell.
For a few seconds I was stone deaf.
Never felt such an odd sensation.
Not the deafness, but the return of
hearing. First, perfect silence in the
midst of the turmoil&mdash;then the crack!
crack! bang! bang! as if you had
suddenly flung open a door. Not a
man of us was hurt. "Got an English
paper?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"I've got some intelligence for
you, old chap, not in this morning's
<cite>Times</cite>. Just look up there, in front."</p>

<p>The view in front was striking and
picturesque. Right above us, dimly
visible through the smoke, on the
verge of the platform or table-land
which we were mounting to assault,
appeared a regiment of French infantry,
enough of them to eat us up,
advancing upon us with an irregular
fire, and led on by their colonel. He
rode a showy horse; and, hat in
hand, waved them on, while his
white hairs streamed in the wind,
and his whole bearing announced the
brave old soldier. "We must form
line," said Tom. It was done forthwith,
with steadiness, order, and
rapidity. "Make ready&mdash;present&mdash;fire."
Crack! went all the muskets
together. I saw the gallant old
colonel, with outspread arms, tumbling
from his horse.&mdash;"Charge!"
We rushed upon the foe; but, when
the smoke had cleared away, found
no foe to fight withal. Nothing was
visible, save their knapsacks in the
distance, poppling up and down in
the smoke, as they scampered off.
We still continued advancing in pursuit,
and now were fairly in for it,
half choked with dust and sulphur.
If it be asked, how far I personally
contributed to the triumphs of that
glorious day, I beg leave to answer:&mdash;Unquestionably
my arm performed
prodigies of valour; of that there
neither is, nor can be, the shadow of
a doubt. But as I should have felt
it extremely difficult to give a distinct
account of my exploits if questioned
on the day, why, of course you
won't expect it now, after the lapse
of six-and-thirty years. Suffice it to
say, we made good our footing on
the platform, drove the enemy from
their position, occupied it ourselves,
took possession of their redoubts, and
formed, with the rest of the British
forces, on the summit of the heights.
The day was our own. But there
was one unfortunate circumstance to
damp our exultation; Cousin Tom
was missing. A sergeant now informed
me he was wounded, and had
gone to the rear.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER XX. AND LAST.</h4>

<p>As victory had crowned our efforts,
and my valuable services were now
no longer required, I determined to
look for Cousin Tom, and walked
down the hill for that purpose. At
its base, I entered a long thicket or
shrubbery. There, amongst the trees,
I found several wounded men, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
their comrades were removing off the
ground. No one could give me the
information that I sought; no one
knew anything of Cousin Tom. Saw
a sergeant sitting on a bank, who, I
soon discovered, was also wounded.
He knew no such officer; had seen
no one answering the description.
"What's your injury, sergeant?"</p>

<p>"A musket-ball in my ankle, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, but hadn't I better help
you to a place of shelter?"</p>

<p>"Much obliged to you, sir; but I
couldn't walk, even with your support.
I'd rather wait till my turn
comes to be carried, if you've no
objections, sir. Much obliged to you,
equally all the same, sir."</p>

<p>"As you please. Can I render
you any assistance? What can I do
for you?"</p>

<p>"If you'd have the kindness, sir,
perhaps you'd be so good and take off
my gaiter. I can't take it off myself,
sir, though I've tried; it does hurt
me so when I stoop forward. I'm
afraid the bleeding will spoil it, sir;
and then I shall be forced to take out
a new pair."</p>

<p>Having performed this office, and
administered a little brandy both topically
and constitutionally, I once
more ascended the hill, thinking it
possible Cousin Tom might be somewhere
nearer the scene of action. I
inquired and looked in every direction,
but without success. Where
are you, Cousin Tom? This time
my steps brought me into one of the
redoubts, which had been carried by
our troops. When I entered, there
were not a dozen men in it. Sunset
was near, and everything over for
the day. Yet just at that moment,
for what reason I know not, perhaps
for a freak, the enemy thought fit to
open upon this all but unoccupied
post, from their own lines nearer the
city, with a heavy fire of shot and
shell. Bang went a shell, knocking
up bushels of earth and mire. Plump
came a round-shot, into the mud
parapet of the redoubt. It was no
use moving; one place was as hot as
another. So we had nothing to do
for it but to stand still and exchange
grins till the pelting was over. I
then took my leave for the evening.
The day indeed was drawing to a
close as I descended the hill; and
happily I succeeded in reaching the
village, and finding the cottage where
Sancho had been left in charge, just
after it became pitch-dark. A cheering
light streamed through the cottage
window; and, on entering, I
found comfortably seated by the
blazing hearth a veterinary surgeon,
who was there in charge of wounded
horses. He very civilly informed me
there were two good beds, so all was
right with respect to accommodation;
and, more civilly still, invited me to
partake of his supper, which was
boiling on the fire. Not having eaten
a morsel since my early breakfast at
Grenade, and having just discovered
that I was enormously hungry, I
accepted the invitation with glee,
took my seat, and cast many a glance
at the boiling, bubbling, and steaming
kettle. Presently the contents were
turned out into a large, old-fashioned
tureen, and displayed to my eager
gaze a compound of various materials,
the chief of which were a fowl, and&mdash;what
d'ye think?&mdash;a pig's heart.
Supper excellent. Bed ditto.</p>

<p>Next day early I resumed my
search for Cousin Tom, but still, alas!
without success. Went from village
to village, inquired from house to
house, searched the whole neighbourhood.
Lots of wounded officers, but
not the man I sought. Throughout
the day my search was unsuccessful.
Towards night I was passing through
a street of scattered houses, a sort of
hamlet, and was beginning to think
of securing a lodging and a dinner.
Wolves rouse at sunset; and I distinctly
felt one gnawing at my
stomach. At this painful juncture,
much to my satisfaction, at the door
of a cottage I discovered a jolly
acquaintance, whom I beg to introduce
as my "Fat Friend." He was
one of the smartest clerks amongst
our civilians, and probably the youngest;
under, rather than over fifteen;
in short, a chubby boy, who somehow
or other had broken away from his
mother's apron-strings, and obtained
a post, which he filled in a way that
did him credit. In one respect he
was precocious; namely, that he soon
proved himself up to all the waggery
and villainy of headquarters. Moreover,
he had a vast idea of maintaining
his importance, and could take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
his own part; was touchy in anything
that affected his manhood; and,
if you offended him, punched your
head; brushed up to fine women,
with a marked preference for a
bouncer. Yet, after all, he was but
an overgrown boy, and often afforded
us sport by his mannish airs. "Ah,
Fatty, is that you? Glad to see you.
Got any room?"</p>

<p>"Plenty, plenty," said Fatty;
"good entertainment for man and
horse. Glad to see you; and glad to
see the pony. Here, Francisco, take
Sancho, and give him some corn.
Come in, old fellow. Sit down, and
make yourself comfortable. Dreadful
dull here&mdash;horrid! Left in charge
of the departmental boxes."</p>

<p>"I say, Fatty; have you dined?"</p>

<p>"Dined? We dined an hour ago."
Fatty saw his advantage, and was
resolved to make the most of it.</p>

<p>"Well, what did you have for
dinner? Got any cold beef?"</p>

<p>"Why, where have you been?"
said Fatty; "haven't seen you these
two days. Oh, I suppose you got
into Toulouse. Lots of fine gals?"</p>

<p>"Answer my question, and I'll answer
yours."</p>

<p>"Come out, old fellow. Let's take
a turn through village before it gets
dark. Dinner? Why, a turkey. Sorry
you were not with us to partake.
Not a morsel left. Picked the old
gobbler clean, drumsticks and all."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd let me send your
fellow for some beef."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Fatty, "send him
by all means. Sorry to inform you
it's no use, though. Not a morsel of
rations to be had; not a biscuit.
What, haven't you <cite>dined</cite>?" I saw
he meant to have his joke, so made no
reply.</p>

<p>There was a dodge, though; my
remedy was in my pocket. Brought
out a cigar, one of my choice grenadiers;
struck a light, blew a fragrant
cloud, took it easy. The rich odour
diffused itself through the apartment.</p>

<p>Fatty, knowing in cigars, soon discovered
that mine was no common
weed. He first drew a sniff; then
gave utterance to his emotions in a
coaxing and admiring "Oh!" I took
no notice.</p>

<p>"Come, old fellow," said Fatty;
"hand out one of those."</p>

<p>"Lost your cigar-case?"</p>

<p>"No, no; nonsense. Come, give
us one; that's a good chap."</p>

<p>Failing in his request, Fatty sat
silent and fidgetty. The first finished,
I lit a second.</p>

<p>Fatty watched his opportunity;
made a vicious grab at the case. I
was too quick for him&mdash;knew his
ways. Down he sat again; tried all
the varieties of entreating, threatening,
bullying, wheedling, till cigar the
second was burnt out. When I extracted
the third, Fatty could stand it
no longer; made a rush, and commenced
a ferocious assault, pitching it
in, right and left. The punches came
so fierce and fast, I was at length
compelled, in self-defence, to administer
a slight persuader, and Fatty found
it convenient to resume his seat. He
sat awhile, sulky and all but blubbering;
then hastily rose, and stalked
out of the room in high dudgeon. I
presently found him stationed at the
front door with his hands in his pocket,
very pensive and dignified. Shortly
after, he slipped into the house; Francisco
appeared with the tablecloth and
a bottle of wine; then came half a
turkey and the cold beef. After dinner
we clubbed our resources, and closed
the evening with whisky punch and
prime cigars.</p>

<p>Next morning early, started afresh
in search of Cousin Tom. Near Toulouse,
fell in with Gingham&mdash;told him
my difficulties. "Come up the hill,"
said Gingham; "I'll go with you.
There, no doubt, we shall find your
cousin's regiment." On reaching the
summit of the heights, we found our
way in the first instance into the
Colombette redoubt; the same in
which, on the day of the fight, the
brave Forty-second had been suddenly
overwhelmed by a superior force, and
had lost four-fifths of its numbers.
Within the redoubt were standing two
or three privates; they belonged to
the Forty-second. The uniform at
once reminded me of Corporal Fraser,
the trusty companion of my march to
headquarters. I asked one of the
privates, did he know the Corporal.
"He joined about three weeks ago,
sir."</p>

<p>"Hope he's well. Where is he
now?"</p>

<p>"He's there, sir," said the man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
pointing to the parapet of the redoubt.
I looked, but saw no one.</p>

<p>"The earth," said Gingham,
"seems to have been recently stirred
there. That mound, I think, is not
many days old." Then, addressing
the soldier, "your regiment suffered a
heavy loss. Is that where you buried
after the action?"</p>

<p>"That's the place, sir." The man
then walked away, as if little disposed
for conversation.</p>

<p>We did not pause to calculate how
many bodies would fill a space commensurate
with the length, breadth,
and altitude of the soil displaced.
There lay the slain of a gallant regiment,
in the redoubt they had so nobly
won. There lay Corporal Fraser,
who, in all the difficulties of our
march, had shown himself trustworthy,
fearless, intelligent, and energetic.
He had longed to join ere the day of
combat, and had found a soldier's
grave.</p>

<p>We discovered at length the sergeant
who had informed me of my
cousin's wound. He now pointed to
a large house, near the thicket at the
bottom of the hill. While searching
for Cousin Tom on the day of the
fight, I was close to that same house,
but without seeing it. From our present
elevated position it was distinctly
visible, though not from the low
ground, amongst trees and underwood.</p>

<p>Our approach to the house led us
through the thicket. While making
our way among the trees, we both,
Gingham and I, came to a halt at the
same instant. The sight which arrested
our steps was new to Gingham,
not to me. I saw, on that spot, an
object that I had seen two days before.
The sergeant whom I had then
found wounded was still sitting there,
on the same bank, in the same attitude!
There he had sat the whole
time, overlooked by the bearers, and
unable to move. Viewed at the distance
of a few paces, his aspect
scarcely appeared changed. It was
the identical figure&mdash;I remembered
him at once. But on a nearer inspection,
the alteration was but too manifest.
His eye was glazed, and half
shut. His face was that of a corpse.
He sat up, like a dead man galvanised.
"What, still here, sergeant? Has
nobody come to remove you yet."</p>

<p>He attempted to speak&mdash;paused&mdash;at
length found utterance. "Sorry I
didn't accept your offer, sir." His
voice was low and husky, but distinct.</p>

<p>"Come," said Gingham, "you
mustn't refuse this time. We'll soon
carry you into the house just by."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; thank you, gentlemen.
Would you have the kindness
though&mdash;I should be sorry to lose my
gaiter."</p>

<p>The gaiter secured, we prepared to
lift the sufferer from his seat, and he
on his part made a feeble effort to rise.
The attempt brought on a gush of
pain. For a moment, his features
were distorted with intolerable anguish;
the next, he fainted in our
arms.</p>

<p>"Now then," said Gingham, thrusting
back into his sidepocket a small
flask which he had just drawn out.
"Now then; away with him at once,
before he recovers. Come, Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;;
you take his shoulders, I'll take his
legs. It may save him further pain."</p>

<p>We bore the sufferer, still senseless,
to the house. Gingham, not having
a hand to spare, banged at the door
with his foot. It was opened by Mr
Staff-surgeon Pledget, who bowed on
recognising us, but looked rather perplexed
at the unexpected addition to
his duties.</p>

<p>Pledget gave instant directions for
the accommodation of the wounded
man, and informed me, in reply to
my inquiries for Cousin Tom, that he
had an officer under his care, answering
to my description. Pledget appeared
bewildered, and stood with us
in the passage a few moments, without
speaking. At length he opened the
door of a small chamber close by, and
begged us to enter. He placed chairs
for us, and seated himself on the bed.
"I'm rather exhausted," said he.</p>

<p>"I fear after such a fight," said
Gingham, "your duties must be heavy
indeed."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Pledget, looking
distressed and rather wild. "I have
had much work, and little assistance;
a long spell, too."</p>

<p>"Why, you began, I suppose," replied
Gingham, "early on the day of
the fight."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pledget; "and I've
been at it ever since. Let me see:
two days and two nights, isn't it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Yes, and now going on for the third.
Here have I been operating, bandaging,
taking up arteries, taking off
arms and legs, night and day, without
time to lie down, almost without a
moment to eat. In fact," said he,
looking about the room like a man
lost, "this is the first time I've sat
down these eight-and-forty hours."</p>

<p>Pledget's look bore full testimony
to his toils. Three weeks' illness could
hardly have wrought a greater change.
Nor was his appearance mended by
his garb. He wore a sort of operating
gown similar to that employed
in dissecting; a long pinafore with
sleeves, protecting the whole person
from the chin to the feet, tied round
the middle, and closing with a fold
behind. The front was spotted in
every part with jets of blood from
wounded arteries. Some of the stains
had dried on, and blackened where
they dried; others, more recent, were
still moist and crimson. Blood was
on his unshaven and haggard face;
and on his hands, too, wore marks of
blood.</p>

<p>Gingham eyed him with a look of
deep concern. "I really fear," said
Gingham, "you've been quite overdone."</p>

<p>"I did hope, before this," replied
Pledget, "to be relieved by other
gentlemen of my own department. I
have but one medical assistant, and
he, at this moment, can afford me no
help, for I have been forced to leave
him sitting with his finger on a
wounded artery; and if he takes it
off but for a few seconds, the major's
a dead man."</p>

<p>Pledget now looked like a man that
can't remember what's next. "Oh,"
said he, in all absent tone, "so peace
is really concluded. Come, Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;,
suppose we go and look for your
cousin. His case, I'm happy to say,
is not serious. The ball will be extracted
this evening, and then, I hope,
he will do well."</p>

<p>Pledget spoke, but did not stir.
"By the bye," he added, "you know
Captain Gabion? I think you do.
Oh yes, I recollect; we were all three
fellow-passengers from Lisbon to Falmouth.
No, no, what am I saying?
From Falmouth to Lisbon. His case
is past hope. He can hardly live
through the night."</p>

<p>Gingham and I rose at once from
our seats. For the moment, the imminent
danger of a man we so highly
esteemed, expelled from my thoughts
even Cousin Tom. Pledget also
rose, as if to lead the way, but again
lapsed into forgetfulness. His mind
was evidently worn out, as well as
his body. "Well," said he, "I'm
glad we've got Toulouse.&mdash;Gentlemen,
I beg your pardon. This way,
if you please; up stairs."</p>

<p>He led the way. Every open
door, as we passed through the spacious
mansion, discovered a room
crowded with wounded and dying
men, in beds, or on the ground. Or,
if we saw not into the apartment,
sounds were heard, which told of
anguish and laceration within. We
were conducted by Pledget into a
large room on the first floor, filled,
like the others, with every form of
suffering. Some, slightly wounded,
sat round the fire, on which cookery
was proceeding in kettles of every
size and shape. One officer, bandaged
round the head, had become
delirious. He alternately laughed
and whimpered, muttered and sang.
Another sat near him, moaning, with
his arm in a sling. A spent cannon
ball had smashed the bones from the
elbow to the wrist, without inflicting
an external wound. Every bed had
an occupant; and many lay upon the
floor, with only a blanket under
them. My eye glanced round the
apartment, and lighted on the pinched
features and pallid visage of Captain
Gabion.</p>

<p>He lay on his back in bed. Death
was legible in his aspect. His eyes
were all but shut; but, from time to
time, a convulsive twitching of the
muscles suddenly expanded them to
their full width. To all appearance,
he was perfectly insensible. His
breathing was irregular and laborious;
but the expression of his countenance,
except when disfigured by the spasms
which occasionally shot through his
frame, and jerked him from head to
foot, was, as in health, calm and
dignified. Strange indeed were the
vicissitudes, strange was the contrast,
between the rigid tranquillity of one
moment, and the awful distortion of
the next. Now, it was the quivering
play of features pulled by muscular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
contraction; now, the monumental
repose of marble.</p>

<p>"I fear," whispered Gingham
to Pledget, "you view the case
unfavourably." Pledget hopelessly
raised his eyes.</p>

<p>"The Captain has been insensible,"
said Pledget, "ever since he was
brought in; and probably will continue
so till he expires."</p>

<p>We turned from this sad spectacle,
without exchanging a syllable. A
handkerchief was whisked in my
face. I looked round; there was the
man I wanted. In the next bed,
tucked in, with smiling face, little
changed since we parted, a splendid
specimen of the ugly-handsome&mdash;those
fellows that make the biggest
holes in ladies' hearts&mdash;lay Cousin
Tom. Gingham, my object attained,
forthwith took a temporary leave&mdash;had
urgent business in Toulouse&mdash;an
appointment&mdash;would return as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>"Fine fellow, that" said Cousin
Tom, craning round, and nodding at
Captain Gabion.</p>

<p>"Well, Tom," said I; "what's the
matter with <small>YOU</small>? What brought <small>YOU</small>
here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not much; nothing," replied
Tom, curling out his lips contemptuously,
like a disappointed man;
"only a musket-shot. It won't get
me a step, I'm afraid; no, nor a
pension neither."</p>

<p>"Well, but how was it? When
was it? We lost you in a moment."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you just how it happened,"
said Tom. "You saw the
old colonel knocked over. Ah!
Don't touch the bed; that's a good
fellow. Well. Directly after, you
know, we charged. I was running
on; felt a smart crack in the small
of my leg. Thought it was a stone;
took no notice. A few paces further,
though, found I couldn't walk. The
sergeant looked at my leg; said
'You're wounded, sir.' Wounded I
was, sure enough; and disabled, too.
Got carried to the rear; placed myself
in the doctor's&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Tom suddenly knit his brows.
His colour changed in an instant
from florid to livid; his whole face
was distorted with pain. Clapping
his handkerchief to his mouth, he
chewed away at it with all his might,
while big drops of sweat started out
on his forehead, and he drew in
breath till the bedclothes heaved.
Next moment he was himself again.</p>

<p>Once more Tom nodded at the
next bed. "Known him long? The
doctor knows him."</p>

<p>"We came over from England, all
three of us in a ship."</p>

<p>"Doctor was out, though, in one
thing," said Cousin Tom. "Told
you he was insensible ever since he
came in. No such thing; this morning
he revived; for about an hour
seemed quite himself. Told me how
he got hit."</p>

<p>"Then tell me. I must communicate
with his friends in England."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Tom, "the Captain
wasn't on duty here at headquarters;
was doing some field-works
on the left bank of the river, to be
ready for Soult in case of his bolting
again for the south. He heard,
though, that the fight was coming
off; so rode in on the morning.
Found out there was to be a flank
movement to the left; thought he
might as well explore the line of
march; went forward alone. Passed
through the thicket on foot; made his
way from one end to the other.
When he reached the further extremity,
just where our men got such
a pounding afterwards from the guns
on the heights, he looked out for the
enemy's skirmishers; saw no one;
thought he might as well go a little
further. Just then our batteries at
the right opened on the French position;
some of our shots flew too
high, and came clean over the hill
into the lane, just exactly where he
was standing."&mdash;Indeed! I thought
of Captain Gabion's dream.&mdash;"Well;
he saw one coming; didn't trouble
himself; it seemed spent. Just when
he thought it was going to stop, it
fetched a pitch; took him in the side.
He was found when our troops advanced,
and brought in here." At
this moment the pain returned. Tom
again made wry faces, took another
chew at his handkerchief, and soon
recovered as before.</p>

<p>"Well, Tom; I'm a leisure man.
What can I do for you? Is there
anything you want?&mdash;anything I can
get you?"</p>

<p>Cousin Tom looked very much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
if there was something he did want,
yet was backward to speak. "Why,"
said he, "I suppose by this time you
can get into Toulouse. I wish you
would make inquiries; try and find
me some&mdash;But never mind; it's of no
use. The ball will be extracted this
evening, and to-morrow I shall go in
myself."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, nonsense; I'll go this
instant."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that, though,"
said Tom. "Yesterday morning I
tried it. Told the servant to have my
mule ready; got my things on while
the doctor was sawing away on the
other floor; slipped down stairs; gave
him the go-by. Mounted&mdash;rode to
the top of the hill&mdash;was riding down
into the city&mdash;almost rode into a
French piquet."</p>

<p>"No fear of that now, Tom; the
city is ours. I saw the French troops
marching out. Come, tell us, old
fellow. What is it you fancy? Anything
the doctor sanctions, you know.
A quarter of mutton?&mdash;a dozen of
pigeons?&mdash;some prime French sausages?&mdash;a
bushel or so of oysters?
What do you say to a brace of
biddies?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!&mdash;oh, no!" said Tom, as
if the very mention of biddies made
him sick. "We were always in advance;
got fowls and turkeys till we
hated the sight of them."</p>

<p>"Any dish from a French cuisine,
then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;oh, no! Nothing French,
nothing Frenchified. What I want,
if it's to be got at all, is not to be got
good, except in England&mdash;or the West
Indies."</p>

<p>"Well, but, you know, Bordeaux
is open; West India produce has come
into the country by ship-loads. What
is it? Come, just tell us, old chap,
and I'll go and get it for you at once,
if it's to be had in Toulouse."</p>

<p>Tom was not so well as he looked;
and there was evidently something
for which, like other sick persons,
he was inwardly pining. Now that
I had held out a prospect of its
attainment, his cheek flushed, and his
eye gleamed with feverish eagerness.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Tom, "I wish
you would try and get me&mdash;but it's no
use; it's a shame to bother you.&mdash;I
say, though, can you spare the time?
Have you really nothing to do? Upon
your honour?&mdash;I've been longing for
them, day and night, ever since I got
here. Oh, if you could only get me&mdash;some
tamarinds!"</p>

<p>His eye, while he spoke, fixed full
on mine. He watched my countenance
with the anxiety of a dying man when
he makes his last request. "I'll be
off and try this instant," said I, though
really fearing there was little chance
of success.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you&mdash;thank you!"
cried Cousin Tom. I was going.
"Here&mdash;here! Come back! I want
to speak to you!" I returned. "Old
fellow," said Tom, with a coaxing,
eager grin, "make haste now, will
you? Bring 'em directly&mdash;that's a
good chap."</p>

<p>"Well, but, you know&mdash;if tamarinds
can't be had for love or money,
is there nothing else?"</p>

<p>"No, stupid&mdash;no! Tamarinds, I
say; get me some tamarinds. What
did I tell you? Didn't I tell you
tamarinds? Now then; what are
you waiting for? Cut away, and be
hanged to you! Be off!&mdash;be off!"</p>

<p>I entered the ancient and very interesting
city of Toulouse, and rushed
through streets choked with cars of
wounded men, in search of tamarinds.
The search was tedious, and far from
satisfactory. I inquired at all the
likeliest shops; found only two where
they professed to sell tamarinds. The
samples were similar: a made-up,
sticky mess; a black, nauseous electuary,
with a beastly pharmaceutical
odour, and barely the flavour of
tamarinds.</p>

<p>It was no pleasant thought returning
to poor Tom with a big gallipot of
this filthy compound stowed in each
of my coat pockets. Yet, though bad
thus to baulk him, it was worse to
keep him in suspense; so I started on
my return with all speed, and, in my
speed, came full butt against a passenger,
who hugged me like a wrestler,
to prevent a mutual capsize.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;! Glad to see you
so active. Something of importance,
no doubt: official duty, I suppose."</p>

<p>It was Gingham! I told him my
troubles, my pursuit in behalf of
Cousin Tom, and my disappointment.
Had searched all Toulouse, and could
find no good tamarinds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall be happy to supply you,"
said Gingham, "in any quantity your
cousin can require. Got a whole
kegful&mdash;capital. Always take some
with me when I visit the Continent.
Got them on Fish-street Hill." We
walked off forthwith to Gingham's
quarters.</p>

<p>I was speedily on my return to
Cousin Tom, with Gingham for my
companion, and a good jar of prime,
sweet, wholesome, unsophisticated
tamarinds. On approaching Tom's
bed, I held up the jar in triumph.
Tom raised himself without saying a
word, tucked his handkerchief under
his chin, and sat up, poor fellow, like
a child, with eyes half-closed and
mouth half-open, eager to be fed. In
went a spoonful. The next instant&mdash;bolt!&mdash;it
was gone! What a swallow!
He sat as before, ready for another.
A second allowance vanished with
equal speed. Down it goes! Why,
it's like feeding a young rook!&mdash;Tom
now laid himself down again,
exhausted. "Here," said he; and
made me a present of a handful of
tamarind stones. "Now put a good
lot in that jug, and fill it up with
water."</p>

<p>While the drink was mixing, an
unusual sound called our attention to
the adjoining bed. Captain Gabion
was fast sinking. His respiration,
laborious from the first, had now
become painfully audible; in fact, he
did not breathe, he gasped. The
convulsive movements had ceased.
His face retained its natural expression;
but there was that in his look
which told us he was a dying man.
I felt at the moment an impression,&mdash;He
is not insensible! His lips moved.
Surely he is trying to speak! He
strove to fix his eyes on us, but could
not. I stooped down, observing his
lips again in motion. Yes, he was
speaking. I caught only the words&mdash;"On
the platform."</p>

<p>"The Calvinet platform?" I whispered
in reply. "Is that the spot
where you wish&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Feebly, tremulously he pressed my
hand, which had just before taken his.
I had caught his last request, then; a
grave on the summit of Mount Rave,
the key of the French position, where
the table-land, crowned with redoubts,
had been carried by our troops. His
breathing became gradually feebler
and less perceptible. The moment
when it ceased entirely, no one present
could determine. This only was
evident:&mdash;a minute before, he had
given signs of life; and now, he had
passed into another world!</p>

<p>Cousin Tom's bullet was extracted
the same afternoon, with immediate
relief to the patient. During the operation
I was present, by Tom's request;
and friendship, let me tell you,
has more pleasing duties than that
of attending on such emergencies.
Tom, however, made it as agreeable
as he could. Throughout the process
he viciously stared me full in the face,
grinning most horribly from time to
time, half in agony, half in fun.
When the forceps was produced, he
caught a glimpse of that terrific implement,
and twisted his ugly mug
into such a comical grimace, that
mine, spite of the solemnity of the
occasion, was screwed into a smile.
Tom thereupon clenched his fist, with
a look that said ferociously, "Laugh
again, and I'll punch your eye."</p>

<p>The bullet, doctor, had lodged between
the bones of the leg, a little
above the ankle, and, I need not inform
you, came out rather flattened.
Tom kept it as a bijou, in a red morocco
case made express by an artist
in Toulouse. Tom called it his pill-box.
Neither bone was broken; but
the strain of this disagreeable visitant
wedged in between them, and rending
them apart, had occasioned from
time to time those awful twinges,
which Tom assuaged by taking a
chew at his handkerchief. The
enemy removed, he not only found
himself in a state of comparative
ease, but was relieved from the constitutional
irritation which had begun
to manifest itself by hardness of
pulse, dryness of the mouth, parched
lips, a dull, hectic, brickdust-coloured
patch on each cheek, a feverish lustre
of the eye, and an enormous appetite
for tamarinds.</p>

<p>The operation, though, I ought to
have said, was not performed by
Pledget, but by another army surgeon,
who had arrived in the course
of the day, not before he was wanted.
Poor Pledget was quite done up.
His powers, both mental and physical,
had evidently been over-taxed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
He looked haggard and wild. Yet
still, though relieved, anxious about
his cases, he wandered from room to
room, and fidgeted from one patient
to another; standing a while in
silence, with his hands behind him,
first by an amputation, then by a
wounded artery, then by a contusion,
then by a broken head; while his
care-worn countenance expressed
pleasure or pain, according to the
symptoms. As Cousin Tom was now
in a dreadful fuss to be off for Toulouse,
Gingham and I applied to the
newly-arrived surgeon, and consulted
him as to the removal.</p>

<p>"I think, gentlemen," said he, "if
no bad symptoms supervene in the
night, it may safely be effected to-morrow;
that is, of course, with
proper care and precautions."</p>

<p>"You are not afraid, sir," said
Gingham, "that to-morrow may be
too early a day, then?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, to say the truth," replied
the doctor, "if we had more
room here, better accommodations,
and a less vitiated atmosphere, I should
say a later day would be better. But,
under existing circumstances, less
evil, I think, is likely to arise from
the patient's removal, than from his
remaining. In his case, what we now
have most to look to, is the general
health. Keep that right, and the
wound, I hope, will do well. Therefore
the sooner he is withdrawn from
the bad air, and the associations
which surround him here, the better
for him." The doctor paused.&mdash;"Pray,
sir," said he, looking Gingham
full in the face, as though intuitively
knowing he spoke to a real good
fellow, "pray, sir, if you will permit
me to ask the question, is Mr Pledget
a friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"There are few men, sir," replied
Gingham, "for whom I have a higher
regard, than for Mr Pledget."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the doctor, "I
feel rather uneasy about him. It's a
delicate thing to speak about. But
you yourself must have noticed how
changed he is, by the labours of the
last three days. In short, to speak
plainly, he requires to be looked after;
and just at this time, with so many
wounded upon our hands, I hardly
know whether we could possibly give
him the attention here which his
case requires. If it is neglected now,
it may become serious. Would it be
asking too much, if I requested you to
take charge of him into Toulouse?"</p>

<p>"Take him with us this instant,
sir," said Gingham; "or when you
please. If you approve, I'll have him
with me in my own quarters."</p>

<p>"I really, sir, feel obliged to you,"
said the doctor. And the doctor
looked as if he spoke from his heart.
"Hope you understand, though, what
it is you are taking on your shoulders.
For a few days&mdash;not longer, I hope&mdash;he
will require vigilant superintendence,
and, possibly, slight control.
His case demands firmness, and indulgence
at the same time."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I understand," said
Gingham. "Shall he go with us
now?"</p>

<p>"I would rather have him under
my eye," said the doctor, "till to-morrow
morning. Perhaps a night's
rest may effect a favourable change.
In the interval, too, I shall have time
to prepare his mind for the removal."
So it was settled.</p>

<p>The next morning we returned to
the chateau, for the purpose of bringing
in Pledget and Cousin Tom.
Tom's patience, though, had not lasted
out till our arrival. At sunrise, again
giving the doctor the go-by, he had
got on his things, crept down stairs,
mounted his mule, and taken himself
off. In fact, he had got into Toulouse,
obtained a billet, and, snugly located
in a respectable French family, was
prattling the vernacular, which he
had at his fingers' ends, before we
arrived at the chateau to fetch him.</p>

<p>It only remained, therefore, to remove
Pledget. He, poor man, though
all the better for a night's rest and a
clean shirt, still looked very unlike
himself. He had rested, indeed, but
he had not slept; and his medical
colleague hinted to Gingham, ere we
departed, that the case still required
vigilance and care. The state of
Pledget's mind, at this time, was singular;
he had all at once become excessively
ceremonious. When we
reached the garden gate he drew up;
insisted that we should both precede
him in going out. Had Gingham and
I been equally punctilious, we should
not have reached Toulouse by dinner-time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Gingham had a matter upon his
mind. Captain Gabion having expressed
a last wish respecting his
funeral, Gingham had undertaken the
whole details, and some arrangements
had been necessary at the chateau, or
our departed friend would speedily
have been consigned, on the spot, to
a ready-made grave. Gingham mentioned
the subject as we rode along,
and began stating what steps he had
taken. Pledget, who was ambling
side by side with us on his mule, suddenly
fell behind. Coosey, previously
admonished by Gingham, kept still
further in the rear. We waited till
Pledget came up.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr Pledget," said Gingham,
"I thought we had lost you,
sir."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," said Pledget,
with gravity; "you are making a
confidential communication. Part of
it I unintentionally overheard. For
this, an apology is due to both of
you. Gentlemen, I most humbly beg
your pardon."</p>

<p>We rode on. Presently, Pledget
edged up alongside of me, as though
he had something important to communicate.</p>

<p>"Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;," said he, "I consider it
the first duty which one gentleman
owes another, to avoid giving him
needless offence." Not exactly perceiving
to what this observation tended,
I could only bow my acquiescence.</p>

<p>"But if," continued Pledget, "an
offence is actually given, then I conceive
the next duty is to make reparation
by a humble apology." Apology,
it was evident, was now the
uppermost idea in poor Pledget's
mind.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said I, seeking to
divert his thoughts, "I think, in such
a case, regard should be had to the
feelings of both parties. And, judging
by my own, I should say that, next
to making an apology, there are few
things one would more wish to avoid
than receiving one."</p>

<p>"And accordingly," said Gingham,
"in the intercourse of gentlemen, it
rarely, very rarely occurs, that an
actual apology is deemed requisite. To
signify an intention, to express a willingness
to apologise, is in most cases
thought amply satisfactory. Manly
feeling forbids the rest; and honour
itself exacts no more." Pledget rode
on awhile, absorbed in thought.</p>

<p>"Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;," he said at last, "I appreciate
your sentiments, as well as
Mr Gingham's; and I perceive their
drift. Allow me to say it, your conduct
is most generous. I really feel
that you have just cause to complain
of mine; and, if it would pain you to
receive the apology, which is your
due, allow me at least to express my
<em>willingness</em>, and, believe me, it was
my <em>intention</em>, to apologise."</p>

<p>"Mr Pledget, my dear sir, what
possible need of apology between you
and me? What offence has been
given or received? I know of none&mdash;never
dreamt of any."</p>

<p>"Very handsome of you to say so,
Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;," replied Pledget. "But
what could be more inconsiderate than
my conduct yesterday morning? You
<em>must</em> have felt it; I know you did.
You came to me with an anxious
inquiry respecting your wounded
cousin; I spoke to you of Captain
Gabion. It was wrong, I own. Nay,
not merely wrong, it was unfeeling.
I trust you will bear in mind my peculiar
circumstances at the time. I was
overwhelmed, perplexed, bewildered,
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gingham now saw it was high time
to interpose, and with much adroitness
gave a new turn to the conversation.
But ere we were housed in
Toulouse, Pledget, addressing us alternately,
and continually discovering
fresh grounds of self-accusation, had
made two or three more apologies.</p>

<p>For a few days, sedulously and most
kindly tended by Gingham, who managed
him admirably, and evinced
equal tact and delicacy, Pledget continued
in a state of alternate depression
and excitement, with occasional
hallucinations. He made apologies to
all who came near him; and, ere he
quitted Gingham's quarters, had
begged pardon, again and again, of
every servant in the household. From
my first conversation with Gingham
on the steps of the hotel at Falmouth,
I always valued his acquaintance.
But when I had seen him in this his
new character as Pledget's nurse,
wise, thoughtful, vigilant, and indulgent,
I really grew proud of such a
friend.</p>

<p>Within a week Pledget was almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
himself again; and long before he
quitted Toulouse, to embark for England
at Bordeaux, he was fully and
permanently restored.</p>

<p>Cousin Tom's, though, was a business
of more time. He begged or
borrowed a formidable sapling, with a
knob as big as his fist, and was soon able
to hobble about Toulouse, very much
to his own satisfaction. But the
bones of his leg had been injured,
though not broken; and it was long
before the wound got well, if it ever
did. I was with him many months
after in London, when the Medical
Board sat to award gratuities and
pensions to the wounded and disabled
officers of the Peninsular Army.
Lucky, then, did the wight esteem
himself who had lost a limb or an
eye. Tom was waiting for his turn
to go before the Board; I saw him
two days previously. His, I feared,
was only a case for a gratuity; but
Tom was determined to go for a pension,
and made sure of getting it. I
ventured to express my doubts; Tom
whipped off his half-boot, turned down
his sock, and exclaimed triumphantly,
"Look at that!" The wound was
clean, but looked fresh; much, indeed,
as it appeared two days after
the fight when the bullet was extracted,
and still big enough to re-admit it.
"If the Board don't give me a pension,"
cried Tom, "for such a punch
as that, why, all I can say is, they
deserve to be punched themselves."
Saw him again after the inspection.
"It's no go," said Tom; "I tried
hard for it, too. Got up early in the
morning&mdash;slapped twice round the
Park at a swinging pace. When I
went before them it was red all
about, a couple of inches. The flinty-hearted
villains gave me only a gratuity,
though it bled while they were
looking at it."</p>

<p>At an early day after Pledget's and
Tom's removal, we assembled at the
chateau, on an occasion in which we
all felt a melancholy interest&mdash;the
funeral of Captain Gabion. The military
arrangements, of course, did not
rest with us; Gingham had made every
provision which was left to his care
with equal liberality and propriety.
Gingham also, no chaplain being present,
officiated at the grave. He read
the service with great devoutness and
solemnity. The procession was joined,
as we ascended the hill, by a
mounted officer, a major of the artillery,
who, during the whole of the
service, seemed lost in thought, and
stood with his eyes fixed upon the
coffin till it was lowered into the
grave. The whole concluded, he
approached and shook hands with
Gingham and myself, spoke a few
hurried words, took a hasty leave,
mounted, and rode away. Gingham
and I waited by the grave till all was
filled in and made right; we then
walked down together towards the
city, both for some time silent. I
spoke first.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be right to communicate
with the friends? I think they
ought to know the exact position of
the grave, and also the particulars
which I got from my cousin."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Gingham; "it
would, I think, be as well to give
them all the information you can. I
have already written to the widow."</p>

<h2>CHATEAUBRIAND'S MEMOIRS.</h2>

<p><cite>Mémoires d'outre Tombe.</cite> Par M. <span class="smcap">Le Vicomte de Chateaubriand</span>. Tom. v. vi.
vii. viii. et ix. Paris: 1849.</p>


<p>The great and honourable feature
of Chateaubriand's mind, amidst some
personal weaknesses, is its noble
and disinterested character. It differs
from what we see around us, but it
differs chiefly in superior elevation.
It united, to a degree which perhaps
will never again be witnessed, the
lofty feelings of chivalry, with the
philanthropic visions of philosophy.
In the tribune he was often a Liberal
of the modern school; but in action
he was always a paladin of the olden
time. His fidelity was not to prosperity,
but to adversity; his bond
was not to the powerful, but to the unfortunate;
reversing the revolutionary
maxim, he brought the actions of public
men to the test, not of success, but of
disaster. He often irritated his friends
when in power by the independence
of his language, but he never failed to
command the respect of his enemies
when in adversity, by his constancy
to misfortune. "Vive le roi quand-même,"
ever became his principle
when the gales of adversity blew, and
the hollow-hearted support of the
world began to fail. Prosperity often
saw him intrepid, perhaps imprudent
in expression, but misfortune never
failed to exhibit him generous and
faithful in action; and his fidelity to
the cause of royalty was never so
strikingly evinced as when that cause
in France was most desperate. He
was the very antipodes of the hideous
revolutionary tergiversation of Fontainebleau.
A pilgrim in this scene
of trial, he was ever ready, after
having attained the summit of worldly
grandeur, to descend at the call of
honour; and, resuming his staff and
scrip, to set out afresh on the path of
duty. He was fitted to be the object
of jealousy and spite to kings and
ministers in power, whose follies he
disdained to flatter or to overlook their
vices, and of eternal admiration to the
great and the good in every future age,
whose hearts his deeds not less than
his words will cause to throb. Such
a character might pass for fabulous or
imaginary, were it not clearly evinced,
not only by words, but actions; not
only in the thoughts of genius, but in
the deeds of honour. His life, and the
feelings by which it was regulated, are
well worth examining, although we fear
he will find but few imitators in these
days, and is more likely, in a utilitarian
and money-seeking age, to be classed
with the mammoth and mastodon,
as a species of existence never again
to be seen in this world.</p>

<p>A character of this description
naturally became enamoured of awful
or heartstirring events, and was ever
ready to find a friend in those capable
of noble or heroic deeds in the ranks
even of his enemies. Both qualities
are evinced in the following graphic
account of the appearance of the Grand
Army when it arrived at Smolensko
during the Moscow retreat:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the 9th November, the troops at
length reached Smolensko. An order of
Buonaparte forbade any one to enter
before the posts had been intrusted to
the Imperial Guard. The soldiers on the
outside were grouped in great numbers
round the foot of the walls: those within
were under cover. The air resounded
with the imprecations of those who were
shut out. Clothed in dirty Cossack cloaks,
horse-cloths, and worn-out blankets, with
their heads covered with old carpets,
broken helmets, ragged shakos, for the most
part torn by shot, stained with blood, or
hacked in pieces by sabre-cuts&mdash;with
haggard and yet ferocious countenances,
they looked up to the top of the ramparts
gnashing their teeth, with the expression
of those prisoners who, under Louis the
Fat, bore in their right hand their left
cut off: you would have taken them for
infuriated <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">masques</i>, or famished madmen
escaped from Bedlam. At length the
Old and Young Guard arrived, they
were quickly admitted into the place
which had been wasted by conflagration
on occasion of our first passage. Loud
cries of indignation were immediately
raised against the privileged corps. 'Is
the army to be left nothing but what it
leaves?' was heard on all sides. Meanwhile
the household troops, who had been
admitted, rushed in tumultuous crowds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to the magazines like an insurrection of
spectres: the guards at the doors repulsed
them; they fought in the streets:
the dead, the wounded encumbered the
pavements, the women, the children, the
dying filled the waggons. The air was
poisoned by the multitude of dead bodies;
even old soldiers were seized with idiocy
or madness; some whose hair stood on
end with horror, blasphemed, or laughed
with a ghastly air and fell dead. Napoleon
let his wrath exhale in imprecations
against a miserable commissary,
none of the orders given to which had
been executed.</p>

<p>"The army, a hundred thousand strong
when it left Moscow, now reduced to
thirty thousand, was followed by a band
of fifty thousand stragglers; there were
not eighteen hundred horsemen mounted.
Napoleon gave the command of them to
M. de Latour Maubourg. That officer,
who had led the cuirassiers to the assault
of the great redoubt of Borodino, had
had his head almost cleft asunder by
the stroke of a sabre; he afterwards lost
a leg at Dresden. Perceiving his servant
in tears when the operation was over, he
said to him, 'Why do you weep? you
will have only one boot to clean.' That
general, who remained faithful to misfortune,
became the preceptor of Henry V.
in the first years of the exile of that
prince. I lift my hat in his presence, as
in that of the Incarnation of Honour."&mdash;<cite>Memoirs</cite>,
vi. p. 116, 118.</p></blockquote>

<p>As Chateaubriand had declined
office, and narrowly escaped death in
consequence, when Napoleon murdered
the Duke d'Enghien, his life,
from that period to the Restoration
of the Bourbons, was one of retirement
and observation. The important part
which he took in the Restoration, by
the publication of his celebrated pamphlet
<cite>De Buonaparte et des Bourbons</cite>,
restored him to political life. The
effect produced by that work was
immense, and the placing of the
ancient race of monarchs on the
throne was in a great degree owing
to it; for, at a crisis when the
intentions of the Allies were yet undecided,
and Austria openly supported
the strong party in France which
inclined for a regency with Marie
Louise at its head, it swelled immensely
the numbers of the decided
Royalists, and gave a definite and
tangible object to their hitherto vague
and divided aspirations. It was
written with prodigious rapidity, and
bears marks of the haste of its composition
in the vehemence of its ideas
and the occasional exaggeration of its
assertions; but it was the very thing
required for a national crisis of unexampled
importance, when every hour
was fraught with lasting consequences,
and every effort of genius was required
for laying the foundation of a new
order in European society. Of the
first conception and subsequent completion
of this remarkable work he
gives the following account:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I had been permitted to return to my
solitary valley. The earth trembled
under the footsteps of stranger armies: I
wrote like the last Roman, amidst the
din of barbarian invasion. During the
day, I traced lines as agitated as the
events which were passing: at night,
when the roar of cannon was no longer
heard in my solitary woods, I returned to
the silence of the years which sleep in
the tomb, and to the peace of my earlier
life. The agitated pages which I wrote
during the day, became, when put together,
my pamphlet <cite>On Buonaparte and
the Bourbons</cite>. I had so high an idea of
the genius of Napoleon, and the valour of
our soldiers, that the idea of a foreign
invasion, successful in its ultimate results,
never entered into my imagination; but
I thought that such an invasion, by making
the French see the dangers to which
the ambition of Napoleon had exposed
them, would lead to an interior movement,
and that the deliverance of the
French would be the work of their own
hands. It was under that impression that
I wrote my notes, in order that, if our
political assemblies should arrest the
march of the Allies, and separate themselves
from a great man who had become
their scourge, they should know to what
haven to turn. The harbour of refuge
appeared to me to be in the ancient authority,
under which our ancestors had
lived during eight centuries, but modified
according to the changes of time. During
a tempest, when one finds himself at
the gate of an old edifice, albeit in ruins,
he is glad to seek its shelter."&mdash;Vol. vi.
p. 196, 197.</p></blockquote>

<p>Madame de Chateaubriand, in a
note, has described the circumstances
under which this memorable pamphlet
was written, and the morbid anxiety
with which she was devoured during
its composition:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Had the pages of that pamphlet been
seized by the police, the result could not
have been a moment doubtful: the sentence
was the scaffold. Nevertheless the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
author was inconceivably negligent about
concealing it. Often, when he went out,
he left the sheets on the table: at night
he only placed them under his pillow,
which he did in presence of his valet&mdash;an
honest youth, it is true, but who
might have betrayed him. For my part,
I was in mortal agonies: whenever M. de
Chateaubriand went out, I seized the manuscript,
and concealed it on my person.
One day, in crossing the Tuileries, I perceived
I had it not upon me, and being
sure I had it when I went out, I did not
doubt that I had let it fall on the road.
Already I beheld that fatal writing in
the hands of the police, and M. de
Chateaubriand arrested. I fell down in
swoon in the garden, and some kind-hearted
person carried me to my house,
from which I had only got a short distance.
What agony I endured when,
ascending the stair, I floated between
terror, which now amounted almost to a
certainty, and a slight hope that I might
have forgot the pamphlet. On reaching
my husband's apartment, I felt again
ready to faint: I approached the bed&mdash;I
felt under the pillow; there was nothing
there: I lifted the mattress, and there
was the roll of paper! My heart still
beats every time I think of it. Never in
my life did I experience such a moment
of joy. With truth can I say, my joy
would not have been so great if I had
been delivered at the foot of the scaffold,
for it was one who was more dear to me
than life itself whom I saw rescued from
destruction."&mdash;Vol. vi. p. 206, 207.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the entrance of Louis XVIII.
into Paris, on the 3d May 1814, the
Allied sovereigns, from a feeling of
delicacy to that monarch, gave orders
that none but French troops should
appear in the procession. The Old
Guard lined the streets next the palace,
and Chateaubriand gives the
following account of the way in which
they received him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A regiment of infantry of the Old
Guard kept the ground, from the Pont
Neuf to Notre Dame, along the Quai des
Orfures. I do not believe that human
figures ever expressed anything so menacing
and so terrible. These grenadiers,
covered with wounds, so long the terror
of Europe, who had seen so many thousand
bullets fly over their heads, who
seemed to smell of fire and powder&mdash;these
very men, deprived of their leader, were
forced to salute an old king, enfeebled by
time and not combats, guarded by an
army of Russians, Austrians, and Prussians,
in the conquered capital of Napoleon!
Some, shaking their heads, made
their huge bearskins fall down over their
eyes, so as not to see what was passing:
others lowered the extremities of their
mouths, to express their contempt and
rage: others, through their mustaches,
let their teeth be seen, which they
gnashed like tigers. When they presented
arms, it was with a gesture of
fury, as if they brought them down to the
charge. The sound they made with the
recover was like thunder. Never, it
must be admitted, had men been subjected
to such a trial, or suffered such a
punishment. If, in that moment, they
had been called to vengeance, they would
have exterminated the last man, or
perished in the attempt.</p>

<p>"At the extremity of the line was a
young hussar on horseback, with his
drawn sabre in his hand; his whole body
literally quivered with a convulsive
movement of wrath. He was deadly
pale; his eyes rolled round in the most
frightful manner; he opened his mouth
alternately and shut it, grinding his
teeth, and uttering inarticulate cries of
rage. He cast his eyes on a Russian
officer: no words can express the look
which he gave him. When the carriage
of the King passed before him, he made
his horse leap forward, it was easy to
see that he withstood with difficulty the
temptation to precipitate himself on his
sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>"The Restoration, at its very outset,
committed an irreparable fault. It
should have disbanded the army, preserving
only the marshals, generals, military
governors, and officers, in their rank,
pay, and appointments. The soldiers, in
this manner, would have gradually re-entered
their ranks, as they have since
done into the Royal Guard; but they
would have done so isolated from each
other. The legitimate monarch would no
longer have had arrayed against him the
soldiers of the empire in regiments and
brigades, as they had been during the
days of their glory, for ever talking to
each other of times past, and comparing
the conquests of Napoleon with their inglorious
inactivity under their new
master.</p>

<p>"The miserable attempt to reconstruct
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maison Rouge</i>, that mixture of
the military men of the old monarchy and
the soldiers of the new empire, only augmented
the evil. To suppose that veterans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
famous on a hundred fields of
battle should not be shocked at seeing
young men&mdash;brave without doubt, but
for the most part unaccustomed to the
use of arms&mdash;to see them wear, without
having earned or deserved, the marks of
high military rank, was to be ignorant of
the first principles of human nature."&mdash;Vol.
vi. p. 311-313.</p></blockquote>

<p>These observations of Chateaubriand's
are well founded, and the last, in
particular, is very important; but it
may well be doubted whether, by any
measures that could have been adopted,
the support of the army could have
been secured, or the dynasty of the
Bourbons established on a secure foundation.
It was the fact of their having
been replaced by the bayonets of the
stranger which was the insurmountable
difficulty; it was national subjugation,
the capture of Paris, which
had for ever stained the white flag.
This original sin in its birth attended
the Restoration through every subsequent
year of its existence: it was the
main cause of the revolution of 1830,
and operated with equal force in
bringing about the still more fatal one
of 1848. Impatience of repose&mdash;a
desire to precipitate themselves on
foreign nations&mdash;an aversion to the
employments and interests of peace,
were the secret but principal causes of
these convulsions. If either Louis
XVIII. or Louis Philippe had been
young and warlike princes, and the
recollection of Leipsic and Waterloo,
of the invasions of France, and the
double capture of its capital, had not
prevented them from engaging in the
career of foreign warfare; if they
had been enterprising and <em>victorious</em>,
they would have secured the unanimous
suffrages of the nation, and
continued the honoured possessors
of the throne of France. But this
dazzling though perilous career was
denied to Louis XVIII. To him
there was left only the difficult, perhaps
the impossible task, of reconciling
irrevocable enmities, of closing
irremediable wounds, of appeasing
inextinguishable mortifications. They
have been thus set forth in the eloquent
words of genius:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The house of Bourbon was placed in
Paris at the Restoration as a trophy of
the European confederation. The return
of the ancient princes was inseparably
associated, in the public mind, with
the cession of extensive provinces, with
the payment of an immense tribute, with
the occupation of the kingdom by hostile
armies, with the emptiness of those
niches in which the gods of Athens and
Rome had been the objects of a new
idolatry, with the nakedness of those
walls on which the Transfiguration had
shone with a light as glorious as that
which overhung Mount Thabor. They
came back to a land in which they could
recognise nothing. The Seven Sleepers
of the legend, who closed their eyes when
the Pagans were persecuting the Christians,
and woke when the Christians
were persecuting the Pagans, did not
find themselves in a world more completely
new to them. Twenty years had
done the work of twenty generations.
Events had come thick; men had lived
fast. The old institutions and the old
feelings had been torn up by the roots.
There was a new church founded and
endowed by the usurper; a new nobility,
whose titles were taken from the fields
of battle, disastrous to the ancient line;
a new chivalry, whose crosses had been
won by exploits which seemed likely to
make the banishment of the Emigrants
perpetual; a new code, administered by
a new magistracy; a new body of proprietors,
holding the soil by a new tenure;
the most ancient local distinctions effaced,
the most familiar names obsolete. There
was no longer a Normandy, a Brittany,
or a Guienne. The France of Louis XVI.
had passed away as completely as one of
the Preadamite worlds. Its fossil
remains might now and then excite curiosity;
but it was as impossible to put
life into the old institutions as to animate
the skeletons which are imbedded in the
depths of primeval strata. The revolution
in the laws and the form of government
was but an outward sign of that
mightier revolution which had taken
place in the minds and hearts of men, and
which affected every transaction and
feeling of life. It was as absurd to think
that France could again be placed under
the feudal system, as that our globe could
be overrun by mammoths. Louis might
efface the initials of the Emperor, but he
could not turn his eyes without seeing
some object which reminded him he was
a stranger in the palace of his fathers."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As a parallel to this splendid passage,
though in an entirely different
style, we gladly give place to a noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
burst of Chateaubriand, on that most
marvellous of marvellous events, the
return of Napoleon from Elba. It
was natural that so memorable a
revolution should strongly impress
his imaginative mind; but he seems
to have exceeded himself in the
reflections to which it gives rise.
We know not whether to award the
prize to the Englishman or the
Frenchman, in these parallel passages.
They are both masterpieces in their
way. Perhaps the correct view is,
that Macaulay is superior in graphic
force and the accumulation of sarcastic
images; Chateaubriand in lofty
thought and imaginative images.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the 1st March, at three o'clock
in the morning, Napoleon approached the
coast of France in the Gulf of Juan; he
disembarked, walked along the shore,
gathered a few violets, and bivouacked
in an olive wood. The inhabitants withdrew
in a state of stupefaction. He left
Antibes to his left, and threw himself
into the Mountains of Grasse in Dauphiny.
At Sisterone the road passes
a defile where twenty men might have
stopped him; he did not meet a living
soul. He advanced without opposition
among the inhabitants who the year
before had wished to murder him. Into
the void which was formed around his
gigantic shade, if a few soldiers entered,
they straightway yielded to the attraction
of his eagles. His fascinated enemies
seek him and find him not; he
shrowds himself in his glory, as the lion
in the Sahara desert conceals himself in
the rays of the sun to dazzle the eyes of
his pursuers. Enveloped in a burning
halo, the bloody phantoms of Arcola,
Marengo, Austerlitz, Jena, Friedland,
Eylau, the Moskwa, Lützen, and Bautzen,
form his cortege amidst a million of the
dead. From the midst of that column of
smoke and flame, issue at the gates of
towns some trumpet-notes mingled with
tricolor standards, and the gates fly open.
When Napoleon passed the Niemen, at
the head of four hundred thousand foot,
and a hundred thousand horse, to blow
into the air the palace of the Czars at
Moscow, he was less wonderful than
when, breaking his ban, casting his fetters
as a gauntlet in the face of kings, he
came alone from Cannes to Paris, to sleep
peaceably in the palace of the Tuileries."&mdash;Vol.
vi. p. 359, 360.</p></blockquote>

<p>To a mind like that of Chateaubriand,
reposing in solitude when
Napoleon was acting with such marvellous
effect in the world, the character
and qualities of that wonderful
man could not fail to be a constant
object of solicitude and observation.
It has been already noticed that he
braved the Emperor in the plenitude
of his power, and essentially contributed,
in the crisis of his fate, to his
dethronement, and the re-establishment
of the ancient line of princes.
But, as is not unusual with persons
of his highly wrought and generous
temper of mind, his hostility to the
Emperor declined with the termination
of his authority, and his admiration
for his genius rose with the base
desertion of the revolutionary crowd
who had fawned upon him when on
the throne. The following observations
on the style of his writings,
indicate the growth of this counter
feeling, and are in themselves equally
just and felicitous:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"His partisans have sought to make
of Buonaparte a perfect being; a model
of sentiment, of delicacy, of morality,
and of justice&mdash;a writer like Cæsar and
Thucydides, an orator like Demosthenes,
a historian like Tacitus. The public
discourses of Napoleon, his sonorous
phrases in the tent and at the council
board, are the less inspired by the spirit
of prophecy, that many of the catastrophes
which he announced have not
been accomplished, while the warlike
Isaiah himself has disappeared. Prophecies
of doom which follow without
reaching states become ridiculous. It is
their accomplishment which renders them
sublime. During sixteen years, Napoleon
was the incarnation of destiny. Destiny
now is mute, and he, too, should be so.
Buonaparte was not a Cæsar; his education
had neither been learnedly nor carefully
conducted: half a stranger, he was
ignorant of the first rules of our language,
and could hardly spell it; but
what did it signify, after all, that his
expression was defective?&mdash;he gave the
law to the universe. His bulletins have
the most thrilling of all eloquence&mdash;that
of victory. Sometimes, during the intoxications
of success, they affected to be
written on a drum-head: in the midst of
the most lugubrious accents, something
emerged which excites a smile. I have
read all that Napoleon has written&mdash;the
first manuscripts of his infancy, his love-letters
to Josephine, the five volumes of
his discourses, bulletins, and orders; but
I have found nothing which so truly
portrays the character of that great
man, when in adversity, as the following
autograph note left at Elba:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"'My heart refuses to share in ordinary
joys as ordinary sorrows.</p>

<p>"'Not having given myself life, I am
not entitled to take it away.</p>

<p>"'My bad genius appeared to me and
announced my end; which I found at
Leipsic.</p>

<p>"'I have conjured up the terrible
spirit of innovation, which will overrun
the world.'</p>

<p>"Certes, there is Napoleon to the very
life. His bulletins and discourses have
often great energy; but it was not his
own; it belonged to the age; he only
adopted it. It sprang from the revolutionary
energy, which he only weakened
by moving in opposition to it. Danton
said, 'The metal is fused; if you do not
watch over the furnace, you will be consumed.'
St Just replied, '<em>Do it if you
dare</em>.' These words contain the whole
secret of our Revolution. Those who
make revolutions by halves, do nothing
but dig their own graves."&mdash;Vol. vii.
p. 101.</p></blockquote>

<p>Certes, there is Chateaubriand to
the very life.</p>

<p>Chateaubriand, as all the world
knows, was Minister for Foreign
Affairs to Louis XVIII. at Ghent;
adhering thus to his ruling maxim
throughout life, "Fidelity to misfortune."
So great were the services
rendered by him to the cause of
European freedom, by the energetic
series of papers which he poured
forth with unwearied vigour every
week, that there were serious thoughts,
after the battle of Waterloo, of promoting
him to the dignity of Prime
Minister. Louis XVIII. openly inclined
to it; and if his advice had
prevailed, the catastrophe which
fifteen years afterwards befel his
family, would probably have been
prevented. But the insuperable difficulty
lay here: the pure and honourable
mind of Chateaubriand revolted
from the idea of forming a Ministry
in conjunction with Talleyrand and
Fouché; and yet their influence was
such that the monarch, in the first
instance at least, was compelled to
court their assistance. Expedience,
at least immediate expedience, seemed
to counsel it; but Chateaubriand,
animated by higher principles, and
gifted with a more prophetic mind,
anticipated no lasting advantage, but
rather the reverse, from an alliance
with the arch-regicide of Nantes, and
the arch-traitor who had sworn allegiance
to and betrayed <em>twelve</em> Governments
in succession. But the chorus
of "<em>base unanimities</em>," as he expresses
it, with which the monarch was surrounded,
proved too strong for any
single individual, how gifted soever.
Fouché and Talleyrand were taken
into power, and Chateaubriand retired.
Of the conversation with
Louis XVIII., when this vital change
was resolved on, he gives the following
interesting account, which proves
that that sagacious monarch at least
was well aware of the consequences
of the step to which he was thus involuntarily
impelled:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Before quitting St Denis, on our
way back to Paris, I had an audience of
the King, and the following conversation
ensued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Well?' said Louis XVIII., opening
the dialogue by that exclamation.</p>

<p>"'Well, sire, you have taken the Duke
of Otranto,' (Fouché.)</p>

<p>"'I could not avoid it; from my
brother to the bailie of Crussol, (and he
at least is not suspected,) all said that
we could not do otherwise&mdash;what think
you?'</p>

<p>"'Sire! the thing is done; I crave
permission to remain silent.'</p>

<p>"'No, no&mdash;speak out; you know how
I resisted at Ghent.'</p>

<p>"'In that case, sire, I must obey my
orders. Pardon my fidelity: I think it
is all over with the monarchy.'</p>

<p>"The King remained some time silent.
I began to tremble at my boldness, when
his Majesty rejoined:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'In truth, M. de Chateaubriand, I
am of your opinion.'</p>

<p>"I bowed and withdrew; and thus
ended my connection with the Hundred
Days."&mdash;Vol. vii. 70.</p></blockquote>

<p>Manzoni has written an ode, known
over all Europe, on the double fall of
Napoleon: "The last poet," says
Chateaubriand, "of the country of
Virgil, sang the last warrior of the
country of Cæsar.</p>

<p>"He proved everything; glory greater
after danger, flight, and victory: Royalty
and sad exile, twice in the dust, twice on
the altar.</p>

<p>"He announced himself: two ages,
armed against each other, turned towards
him, as if awaiting their fate; he proclaimed
silence, and seated himself as
arbiter between them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding the vehemence of
Chateaubriand's dissension with Napoleon,
it cannot be expected that a
man of his romantic and generous
temperament would continue his hostility
after death. No one, accordingly,
has awarded a more heartfelt or
magnanimous tribute to his memory.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The solitude of the exile and of the
tomb of Napoleon has shed an extraordinary
interest, a sort of prestige, over
his memory. Alexander did not die
under the eyes of Greece, he disappeared
amidst the distant wonders of Babylon.
Buonaparte has not died under the eyes
of France: he has been lost in the gloomy
edge of the southern horizon. The grandeur
of the silence which now surrounds
him equals the immensity of the noise
which his exploits formerly made. The
nations are absent: the crowd of men
has retired: the bird of the tropics,
"harnessed," in Buffon's words, "to the
chariot of the sun," has precipitated itself
from the star of light&mdash;where does it now
repose? It rests on the ashes of which
the weight has all but subverted the
globe."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Imposuerunt omnes sibi diademata
post mortem ejus; et multiplicata
sunt mala in terrâ."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "They all
assumed diadems after his death, and
evils were multiplied on the earth."
Twenty years have hardly elapsed
since the death of Napoleon, and
already the French and Spanish
monarchies are no more. The map of
the world has undergone a change: a
new geography is required: severed
from their legitimate rulers, nations
have been thrown against nations:
renowned actors on the scene have
given place to ignoble successors:
eagles from the summits of the loftiest
pines have plunged into the ocean,
while frail shellfish have attached
themselves to the sides of the trunk,
which still stands erect.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As in the last result everything advances
to its end, '<em>the terrible spirit of
innovation which overruns the world</em>', as
the Emperor said, and to which he had
opposed the barrier of his genius, has resumed
its course. The institutions of the
conqueror fail: he will be the last of
great existences on the earth. Nothing
hereafter will overshadow society, parcelled
out and levelled: the shadow of
Napoleon alone will be seen on the verge
of the old world which has been destroyed,
like the phantom of the deluge on the
edge of its abyss. Distant posterity will
discern that spectre through the gloom
of passing events still erect above the
gulf into which unknown ages have fallen,
until the day marked out by Providence
for the resurrection of social man."&mdash;Vol.
vii. 169-171.</p></blockquote>

<p>Assuredly no one can say that
Chateaubriand's genius has declined
with his advanced years.</p>

<p>To a man viewing Napoleon with
the feelings expressed in these eloquent
words, the translation of his
remains from their solitary resting-place
under the willow at St Helena
could not but be an object of regret.
He thus expresses himself on that
memorable event, and future ages will
probably confirm his opinion:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The removal of the remains of Napoleon
from St Helena was a fault against
his renown. A place of sepulchre in
Paris can never equal the Valley of Slanes.
Who would wish to see the Pillar of Pompey
elsewhere than above the grave dug
for his remains by his poor freedman,
aided by the old legionary? What shall
we do with those magnificent remains in
the midst of our miseries? Can the
hardest granite typify the everlasting
duration of Napoleon's renown? Even
if we possessed a Michael Angelo to design
the statue on the grave, how should
we fashion the mausoleum? Monuments
are for little men, for the great a stone
and a name. At least they should have
suspended the coffin from the summit of
the triumphal arch which records his exploits:
nations from afar should have
beheld their master borne aloft on the
shoulders of his victories. Was not the
urn which contained the ashes of
Trajan placed at Rome, beneath his
column? Napoleon at Paris will be
lost amidst the crowd of unknown names.
God forbid he should be exposed to
the vicissitudes of our political changes,
surrounded though he is by Louis XIV.,
Vauban, and Turenne. Let a certain
section of our revolutionists triumph, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the ashes of the conqueror will be sent to
join the ashes which our passions have
dispersed. The conqueror will be forgotten
in the oppressor of our liberties.
The bones of Napoleon will not reproduce
his genius; they will only teach his despotism
to ignoble soldiers."&mdash;Vol. vii.
184, 185.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Restoration did not immediately
employ Chateaubriand. His
anticipations were realised. The chorus
of baseness and selfishness with which
the court was surrounded, kept him
at a distance. They were afraid of
his genius: they were jealous of his
reputation. Above all, they dreaded
his independence. He was not sufficiently
manageable. They were actuated,
perhaps not altogether without
reason, by the same feeling which
made Lord North say, when urged to
bring Dr Johnson into Parliament,
whose great powers in the political
warfare of pamphlets had been so signally
evinced on the side of Government,
"No, sir, he is an elephant, but
a wild one, as likely to trample under
foot his friends as his enemies." The
veteran statesman, so well versed in
the ways of men, was right. Genius
is the fountain of thought: it ultimately
rules the councils and destinies
of men; but it generally requires
to be tempered by time before it can
be safely introduced into practice.</p>

<p>Chateaubriand enlivens this period
of his memoirs, which is neither signalised
by political event nor remarkable
literary effort, by a sort of biography
of Madame Recamier, with whom he
was on terms of intimate friendship.
This remarkable person, who was
beyond all question the most beautiful
and attractive woman of her
age in France, or perhaps in Europe,
is now no more; and he appears to
have obtained from her relatives, or
perhaps from herself prior to her
decease, not only many curious and
highly interesting details concerning
her early years and subsequent history,
but a great variety of original
letters from the most eminent men of
the age, who were successively led captive
by her charms, but none of whom
appear to have impaired her reputation.
In this country, where the lines
of severance between the sexes are
much more rigidly drawn, it would
be impossible for a young and beautiful
married woman to be in the habit of
receiving the most ardent love-letters
from a great variety of distinguished
and fascinating admirers, without the
jealousy of rivals being excited, and
the breath of scandal fastening upon
her as its natural prey. But it is
otherwise on the Continent, where,
although there is doubtless abundance
of dissoluteness of manners in certain
circles, yet in others such intimacies
may exist, which are yet kept within
due bounds, and cast no reflection on
the fortunate fair one who sees all the
world at her feet.</p>

<p>Such, at least, appears to have
been the case with Madame Recamier,
the intimate friend of Madame de
Stael, who said "She would willingly
give all her talents for one half of her
beauty;" and whose powers of fascination
were such, that she not only inspired
a vehement passion nearly at the
same time, in La Harpe, Lucien Buonaparte,
Murat, Moreau, Bernadotte,
Marshal Massena, Benjamin Constant,
Prince Augustus of Prussia, Prince
Metternich, Chateaubriand, and a
vast many others, but attracted the
particular notice of Napoleon, and did
not escape the vigilant and practised
eye of the Duke of Wellington. The
Prince of Prussia would have married
her, if he could have effected her divorce
from M. Recamier. It is one of the
worst traits of the Emperor Napoleon's
character, that he was not only
so envious of the celebrity of her
beauty that he banished her from
Paris to extinguish its fame, but was
inspired with such malignant feelings
towards her, from her having rejected
his advances, that he got a law passed
which rendered the wives of persons
engaged in commerce responsible in
their separate estates for their husbands'
debts; the effect of which was
to involve Madame Recamier, whose
husband, a great banker in Paris,
failed, in almost total ruin, in the
latter years of her life.</p>

<p>Madame Recamier, whose birth,
though respectable, gave her none of
the advantages of rank or opulence,
was bred up at the abbey of the
<em>Desert</em>, near the confluence of the
Rhone and the Saone at Lyons. Her
parents, however, resided at Paris;
and they having brought her home at
the age of twelve years, she was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
that tender age married to M. Recamier,
a rich banker, almost four times
her own age, whose immense transactions,
which entirely absorbed his
time and attention, left him no leisure
to attend either to the education or
occupations of his infantine and beautiful
wife. But though thus left to
herself, surrounded by admirers, and
with every luxury which wealth could
purchase at her command, she was
never led astray. Benjamin Constant,
who knew her well from her
earliest years, has left the following
interesting portrait of what may be
called her infantine married life:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"She whom I paint emerged pure and
brilliant from that corrupted atmosphere,
which elsewhere withered where it did not
actually corrupt. Infancy was at first her
safeguard. Libertinism shrunk from approaching
the asylum of so much innocence.
Removed from the world in a solitude embellished
by the arts, she spent her time in
the sweet occupation of those charming
and poetical studies which usually constitute
the delight of a more advanced age.</p>

<p>"Often, also, surrounded by her young
companions, she abandoned herself to
the amusements suited to her tender
years. 'Swift as Atalanta in the race,'
she outran all her companions: often, in
playing Hide-and-seek, she bandaged
those eyes which were destined one day
to fascinate every beholder. Her look,
now so expressive and penetrating, and
which seems to indicate mysteries of
which she herself is unconscious, then
shone only with the animated and playful
gaiety of childhood. Her beautiful
hair, which could not be undone without
causing emotion, fell in natural curls on
her shoulders. A hearty and prolonged
laugh often burst from these infantine
circles, but already you could perceive in
her that fine and rapid observation which
seizes the salient points of ridicule&mdash;that
sportive raillery which diverted itself
without injuring any one: above all, that
exquisite sense of elegance and propriety,
of purity and taste, that true nobility
of mind, which are given only to a
few privileged beings.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless Madame Recamier
emerged occasionally from her retreat, to
go to the theatre or to the public promenades;
and in those places of general
resort her rare appearance was quite an
event. Every other object in those immense
assemblages was forgotten: every
one precipitated himself upon her steps.
The fortunate cavalier who attended her
could scarcely make his way through the
crowds which she collected: her steps
were at every instant impeded by the
spectators who crowded around her. She
enjoyed that success with the gaiety of
an infant combined with the timidity of
a young woman; but the gracious dignity
which at home restrained the overflowing
gaiety of her companions, inspired
respect in public in the admiring crowd
with which she was constantly environed.
You would say that her air imposed restraint
equally on her companions and on
the public. Thus passed the first years
of the married life of Madame Recamier,
between poetical occupation, infantine
amusements, and the triumph of beauty
in the world.</p>

<p>"But her expanding mind and capacious
genius soon required other aliment.
The instinctive love of the beautiful with
which she was inspired from her earliest
years, made her long for the society of
men distinguished for the reputation of
their talents or genius. M. de La
Harpe was one of the first who appreciated
the young woman, around whom
were one day to be grouped all the celebrated
characters of her age. The conversation
of that young woman of fifteen
had a thousand attractions for a man of
his great acquirements, and whose excessive
vanity, with the habit of conversing
with the ablest men in France, had rendered
exceedingly difficult to please.
He delighted in being her guide: he was
astonished at the rapidity with which
her talent supplied the want of experience,
and comprehended everything
which he revealed to her of the world
and of men. This was at the moment of
his celebrated conversion to Christianity.
The Revolution having rendered infidelity
all-powerful, scepticism had lost the
merit of being opposed to authority, and
those whom vanity alone had rendered
such could in good faith, and without compromising
their reputation, avow their
secret belief."&mdash;Vol. ix. 118, 121.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the unbounded devotion which
Madame Recamier in a few years
came to inspire in the breasts of the
most distinguished men of her day,
abundant proof is furnished in Chateaubriand's
Memoirs. To give only
a few examples, among a host of
others which might be cited, Marshal
Massena&mdash;a roturier by birth, and
certainly not inheriting by descent
any of the feelings of chivalry&mdash;yet
even he asked a ribbon from Madame
Recamier before he set out for
the army of Italy, to take the command
in Genoa, in the siege since so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
celebrated; and, having obtained it,
he wrote to her the following note
some weeks after:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The charming ribbon given by Madame
Recamier has been borne by General
Massena in the battles and the
blockades of Genoa: it has never left
him, and been, in every instance, the harbinger
of victory."&mdash;Vol. viii. 167.</p>

<p>"There," as Chateaubriand justly
observes "the ancient manners reappeared
athwart the modern manners of which
they formed the base. The gallantry of
the noble chevalier shone forth in the plebeian
soldier; the memory of the tournaments
and of the crusades was concealed
amidst the blaze of glory with
which modern France has crowned its
old victories."</p></blockquote>

<p>Lucien Buonaparte, one of her
first adorers, addressed her early in
life in these terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Till within these few days, I knew
you only by renown. I had seen you
sometimes at church and in the theatres.
I knew you were the most beautiful: a
thousand voices repeated it; and your
charms had struck without dazzling me.
Why has the peace rendered me captive?
it reigns in our families, but sorrow is in
my heart.</p>

<p>"I have seen you since: Jove seemed
to smile on your steps. Seated on the
edge of a fountain, motionless and
dreamy, you gathered a rose. I addressed
you alone: I thought I heard a sigh.
Vain illusion! I soon saw the tranquil
front of indifference seated between us.
The passion which devoured me expressed
itself in my words; while yours bore
the cruel yet amiable stamp of infancy
and sport.</p>

<p>"Be severe, I implore you, for pity's
sake. Banish me from your presence.
Desire me to withdraw from your enchanting
society: and if I can obey the
order, remember only that my heart is
for ever your own; that no one ever
reigned over it as Juliette; and that he
will ever live with her, at least in
memory."&mdash;Vol. viii. 130.</p></blockquote>

<p>"For a man of <em>sangfroid</em>," says
Chateaubriand, "all that is a little
ridiculous." He is right: it is gallantry
without passion which always
appears <em>fade</em> and contemptible. It
is vehemence and sincerity which
makes sentiment interesting. The
Buonapartes had nothing chivalrous in
their breasts: Lucien's letter is very
different from Massena wearing Madame
Recamier's ribbon next his heart
amidst the fire of the Austrian cannon.
But Chateaubriand himself had the
true spirit of chivalry in his bosom.
He thus recounts one of the last moments
which he spent in 1832, late in
life, with Madame Recamier on the
banks of the Lake of Constance:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We wandered as chance guided our
steps, and sat down beside the lake.
From a pavilion in the woods arose a
concert of the harp and the German
horns, which ceased as we began to
listen to them. It was a scene in a fairy
tale. As the music did not recommence,
I read to Madame Recamier my description
of the St Gothard. She asked me
to write something in her pocket-book.
Immediately below the last words of
Rousseau, which were there inscribed,
'Open the windows, that I may again
see the light of the sun,' I wrote, 'What
I felt the want of on the Lake of Lucerne
I have found on the Lake of Constance&mdash;the
charm and the intelligence of beauty.
I no longer wish to die like Rousseau;
I wish, on the contrary, to live long, and
behold the sun, if it is near you that I
am to finish my life. May my days
expire at your feet, as the waves of which
you hear the murmur.' The azure light
of the setting sun coloured the lake; on
the horizon, to the south, the snowy alps
of the Grisons reflected the ruddy glow;
the breeze which swept the waves harmonised
with their ceaseless murmur.
We knew not where we were."&mdash;Vol. x.
246, 247.</p></blockquote>

<p>With the accession of a more Liberal
Administration under M. de Martignac,
Chateaubriand was taken
into power. In 1822 he was sent as
ambassador to London; in 1823 he
was made minister of foreign affairs,
and directed the expedition into
Spain in that year, which had so successful
a result; and in 1824 he represented
France at the Congress of
Verona. He was again, however,
chased from the helm by the jealousy
of the Royalists, whose imbecility was
rebuked by his genius; and it was
not till 1828 that he was again taken
into power, and appointed to the
embassy at Rome. He was there
when the Polignac Administration
was appointed.</p>

<p>We must hasten to the most
brilliant and honourable period of
Chateaubriand's life, that in which he
stood almost alone amidst a nation's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
defection, and singly opposed the revolutionary
torrent by which nearly
all others had been swept away. The
spectacle is at once animating and
mournful: animating as evincing of
what high resolves, of what heroic
constancy, noble minds are capable
even in the extremity of disaster:
mournful, as exhibiting so bright a
contrast to the tergiversation of later
times, and suggesting the mournful
reflection that, in these days of economists
and material enjoyment, the
days of chivalry are gone for ever.</p>

<p>It is well known that Chateaubriand
was esteemed not only a
Liberal, but an ultra-Liberal, by the
extreme Royalist party whom
Charles X. summoned to his councils
on his accession to the throne; and
that, in consequence of his disagreement
with Polignac and the leaders
of that party, he retired from the
ministry, and resigned his appointment
as ambassador at Rome. His
consternation was great on perceiving
the extreme measures which the
Polignac party were preparing to
carry into execution, and the feeble
preparations made for supporting
them by military force, in the midst of
a warlike and excited people. Of
his first intelligence of the appointment
of the Polignac Administration
by the sovereign whom they were destined
so soon to overthrow, he gives
the following account:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Rumours of a change of Administration
had already reached us at Rome.
Well-informed persons had even gone so
far as to speak of Prince Polignac, but I
could not credit the reports. At length
the journals arrive; I open them, and
my eyes rest on the official ordinance
calling him to the head of the ministry.
I had experienced many vicissitudes of
fortune in my journey through life, but
never had I fallen from such an elevation.
My evil destiny had again blown
over my chimeras: that breath of fate
had not only destroyed my illusions, but
it had swept away the monarchy. The
blow was fearful: for a moment I was
in despair, but my part was soon taken.
I felt that I must retire from power.
The post brought me a multitude of
letters; all recommended me to send in
my resignation. Even persons to whom
I was almost a stranger thought themselves
obliged to counsel me to retire. I
was in secret mortified at the officious
interest thus evinced in my reputation.
Thank God, I have never needed nor
waited for counsels when the paths of
honour and of interest lay before me.
Falls from station have ever been to me
ruin, for I possessed through life nothing
but debts; so that when I resigned my
appointments, I was reduced to live by
my wits. In a word, I resigned a situation
of 200,000 francs (£8000) a-year,
and was reduced to nothing; but my
choice was not doubtful. Cast to the
winds, said I to myself, 200,000 francs
(£8000) a-year of income, an appointment
entirely suited to your taste, a
high and magnificent office, the empire of
the fine arts at Rome, the felicity, in fine,
of having at length received the recompense
for your long and laborious
struggles. Honour is to be won, esteem
preserved, at no other price."&mdash;Vol. ix.
141, 142.</p></blockquote>

<p>On arriving at Paris after he had
resigned his appointment as ambassador
at Rome, Chateaubriand found
that many of the kind and officious
friends who had so strongly urged
<em>him</em> to resign, had themselves quietly
accepted appointments under the
Polignac Administration! He withdrew,
however, in pursuance of his
resolution, into private life; and in
order to avoid the expenses of Paris,
which exceeded what his reduced
income could bear, he retired to
Dieppe in June 1830. When there
he received the stunning intelligence
of the Ordinances of July. His part
was immediately taken. He returned
with the utmost expedition to Paris,
resolved to share the fate of his
country whatever it might be, and to
exert himself to the utmost to mitigate
the calamities which he foresaw
awaited it. His first step on arriving
in the capital was to write a letter to
the King, making a tender of his services
to negotiate with the popular
leaders who had got the command in
the capital. The only answer he
received was a verbal one, that M.
de Montemart had been appointed to
the head of the Ministry, and a reference
to him. But M. de Montemart
could not be found; and even if he had
been, affairs had gone too far to admit
of any remedy by individual efforts,
how powerful soever. The nation
would have a Revolution with its
consequences, and it was doomed to
have a Revolution with its consequences.
But although Louis Philippe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was successful, Chateaubriand foresaw
that his throne was established on a
rotten foundation: that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">juste
milieu</i>, resting neither on the attachment
of a loyal, nor the passions of a
conquering people, could not be of
lasting endurance; and that, in default
of all principles of honour whereon to
rest a Government, those of interest
alone remained. He has left the following
memorable prophecy of the
fate awaiting a monarchy cradled in
treason and fostered by selfishness:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Louis Philippe, his Government, the
whole of that impossible and contradictory
combination, <em>will perish in a time
more or less retarded by fortuitous events</em>,
by complications of interests interior
and exterior, by the apathy or corruption
of individuals, by the levity of disposition,
the indifference and want of nerve in
characters. But be its duration long or
short, the present dynasty will not exist
long enough for the House of Orleans to
strike its roots in the soil of France."&mdash;Vol.
ix. 333.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is not in public documents and
actions that the real opinions of the
actors on the stage of public events
are to be discerned. It is their private
conversation or correspondence
that reveals their real sentiments; it
is there that the mental struggles
which preceded the most decisive
steps, and the secret views by which
they were actuated in adopting or
rejecting them, are in truth disclosed.
In this view, the following conversation
between Chateaubriand and the
Duchess of Orleans, immediately after
the triumph of the Barricades, is peculiarly
interesting&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"M. Arago spoke to me in the warmest
terms of the intellectual superiority of
Madame Adelaide; and the Count Analde
de Montesquieu, having met me one
morning at Madame Recamier's, informed
me that the Duke and Duchess of Orleans
would be charmed to see me. I went,
accordingly, to the Palais Royal with the
Chevalier d'Honneur of the future queen.
I found the Duchess of Orleans and
Madame Adelaide in their private boudoirs.
I had previously had the honour
of being presented to the duchess. She
made me sit down near her, and immediately
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Ah! M. de Chateaubriand, we are
very unfortunate. If all parties would
unite we might perhaps be saved, what
think you of that?'</p>

<p>"'Madame,' I replied, 'nothing is so
easy. Charles X. and the Dauphin have
both abdicated; Henry V. is now king;
the Duke of Orleans is now Lieutenant-general
of the kingdom; let him be Regent
during the whole minority of Henry
V., and all is accomplished.'</p>

<p>"'But, M. de Chateaubriand, the people
are extremely agitated; we should fall
into anarchy.'</p>

<p>"'Madame, may I venture to ask you
what is the intention of the Duke of
Orleans? will he accept the throne if it
is offered to him?'</p>

<p>"The two princesses hesitated to answer.
After a short pause the Duchess
of Orleans replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Consider, M. de Chateaubriand, the
disasters which may ensue&mdash;you and all
other men of honour require to unite to
save us from a republic. At Rome, M.
de Chateaubriand, you might render us
essential service&mdash;or even here, if you did
not wish to quit France.'</p>

<p>"'Madame is not ignorant of my devotion
to the young king and to his mother.'</p>

<p>"'Ah! M. de Chateaubriand, how well
they have rewarded your fidelity.'</p>

<p>"'Your Royal Highness would not
wish me to give the lie to my whole life.'</p>

<p>"'M. de Chateaubriand, you do not
know my niece; she is so inconsiderate,
poor Caroline. I will send for the Duke
of Orleans; I hope he may succeed in
persuading you better than me.'</p>

<p>"The princess gave her orders, and in
a quarter of an hour Louis Philippe
arrived. He was dressed in disorder,
and looked extremely fatigued. I rose
as he entered, and the Lieutenant-general
of the kingdom said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The duchess has doubtless informed
you how unfortunate we are.' And
upon that he began a speech on the
felicity which he enjoyed in the country,
and the life, in the midst of his children,
which was entirely according to his
taste. I seized the opportunity of a
momentary pause to repeat what I had
said to the princess.</p>

<p>"'Ah!' he exclaimed, 'that is just
what I desire. How happy should I be to
become the tutor and support of that infant!
I think exactly as you do, M. de
Chateaubriand: to take the Duke of
Bordeaux would unquestionably be the
wisest course that could be adopted. I
only fear events are too strong for us.'</p>

<p>"'Stronger than us, my Lord Duke!
Are you not invested with all powers?
Let us hasten to join Henry V. Summon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the Chambers and the army to meet
you out of Paris. At the first intelligence
of your departure all that effervescence
will subside, and all the world
will seek shelter under your enlightened
and protecting government.'</p>

<p>"While I yet spoke, I kept my eyes
fixed on Louis Philippe. I saw that my
counsels gave him annoyance: I saw
written on his forehead the desire to be
king. 'M. de Chateaubriand,' said he,
<em>without looking me in the face</em>, 'the thing
is not so easy as you imagine: things do
not go as you imagine. A furious mob
may assail the Chambers, and we have,
as yet, no military force on which we can
rely for its defence.'</p>

<p>"The last expression gave me pleasure,
because it enabled me to bring forward
a decisive reply. 'I feel the difficulty
you mention, my Lord Duke; but
there is a sure mode of obviating it. If
you cannot rejoin Henry V., as I have
just proposed, you may embrace another
course. The session is about to open:
on the first proposition made by the deputies,
declare that the Chamber of Deputies
has not the power to determine the
form of government for France; that the
<em>whole nation must be consulted</em>. Your
Royal Highness will thus place yourself
at the head of the popular party: the
Republicans, who now constitute your
danger, will laud you to the skies. In
the two months which must elapse before
the new legislature can assemble, you can
organise a national guard; all your
friends, and the friends of the young king,
will exert themselves in the provinces.
Let the deputies assemble, and let the
cause I espouse be publicly pleaded before
them. That cause, favoured in heart
by you, supported by the great majority
of the country electors, will be certain of
success. The moment of anarchy being
past, you will have nothing to fear from
the violence of the Republicans. I even
think you might win over, by such a
course, General Lafayette and M. Lafitte
to your side. What a part for you to
play, my Lord Duke! You will reign fifteen
years in the name of your young
pupil; at the expiration of that time,
repose will be a blessing to us all. You
will earn the glory, unique in history, of
having had the power to ascend the
throne, and of having left it to the lawful
heir. At the same time, you will have
enjoyed the means of educating that heir
abreast of the ideas of his age: you will
have rendered him capable of reigning
over France. One of your daughters
may aid him to bear the weight of the
crown.'</p>

<p>"Louis Philippe looked around with a
wandering eye and an absent air. 'I beg
your pardon, M. de Chateaubriand,' said
he; 'I left a deputation to converse with
you, and I must return to it.' With
these words, he bowed and withdrew."</p></blockquote>

<p>The advice thus given at the decisive
moment by Chateaubriand was
that of honour and loyalty; it
dictated by the spirit of the chevalier
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans peur et sans reproche</i>. But it was
not that of immediate or apparent
interest; and therefore it was not
adopted. The event has now proved,
however, that in this, as in so many
other instances in this world, the path
of honour and duty would have been
that of expedience. What Chateaubriand
recommended to Louis Philippe
was substantially what Louis
Napoleon <em>did</em>; and the result proved
that the great majority of the nation,
differing widely from the revolutionary
rabble of Paris, was not only Conservative,
but Royalist in its dispositions.
Had Louis Philippe followed
this course, and taken only the regency
till the majority of the Duke of
Bordeaux, the two branches of the
house of Bourbon would have been
cordially united: no discord or jealousies
would have weakened the
Royalist party; the national will
would have been decidedly pronounced
for the monarchy before
it had been rendered an object of
contempt; the Revolution of 1848,
with all its disastrous consequences,
would probably have been prevented;
and as the Duke de Bordeaux has no
family, the Orleans dynasty, as the
next heirs, would have ascended the
throne in the natural order of succession&mdash;and
not only without the bar
sinister of treason on their escutcheon,
but with a deed of unexampled magnanimity
and honour to illustrate their
accession!</p>

<p>Louis Philippe, bent on the immediate
possession of the throne, made
another attempt to gain M. de Chateaubriand;
and for this purpose the
Duchess of Orleans and Madame Adelaide
again sent for him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Madame Adelaide was present as on
the former occasion; and the duchess now
described more specifically the favours
with which the Duke of Orleans proposed
to honour me. She dwelt on what
she called my sway over public opinion;
the sacrifices I had made, and the aversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
which Charles X. and his family had
always shown to me in spite of my services.
She said to me, that if I would
accept the portfolio of foreign affairs, his
Royal Highness would be too happy to
replace me in that situation; but that possibly
I would prefer returning to Rome,
and that she would greatly rejoice at that
appointment, for the interests of our holy
religion.</p>

<p>"'Madam,' I answered with some degree
of vivacity, 'I see that his Royal
Highness has taken his line; that he has
weighed the consequences; that he is prepared
to meet the years of misery and
perils he will have to traverse. I have
therefore nothing to say on that head&mdash;I
come not here to fail in respect to the
blood of the Bourbons; I owe besides nothing
but gratitude and respect to <em>Madame</em>.
Leaving apart, then, those great
objections, founded on reason and principle,
I pray her Royal Highness to allow
me to explain what personally concerns
myself.</p>

<p>"'She has had the condescension to
speak of what she calls my power over
general opinion. Well, if that power is
well founded, on what is it founded? Is it
on anything else but the public esteem:
and should I not lose it the moment I
changed my colours? The Duke of
Orleans supposes he would in me acquire
a support: instead of that he would gain
only a miserable maker of phrases, whose
voice would no longer be listened to&mdash;a
renegade, on whom every one would have
a right to throw dust and to spit in his
face. To the hesitating words which he
could pronounce in favour of Louis
Philippe, they would oppose the entire
volumes he had written in favour of the
fallen family. Is it not I, Madam, who
have written the pamphlet of <cite>Buonaparte
and the Bourbons</cite>; the articles on the
arrival of Louis XVIII. at Compiègne;
the relation of the Royal Council at Ghent,
and the <cite>History of the Life and Death of
the Duke de Berri</cite>? I know not that I
have written a single page where the
name of our ancient kings is not either
mentioned or alluded to, and where they
are not environed by the protestations of
my love and fidelity&mdash;a thing which
marks strength of principle the more
strongly, as<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame</i> knows that, as an
individual, I put no faith in princes. At
the thought even of desertion, the colour
mounts to my cheeks. The day after my
treachery, I should go to throw myself
into the Seine. I implore <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame</i> to
forgive the vehemence of my language:
I am penetrated with her goodness: I
shall ever preserve a profound and grateful
remembrance of it; but she would
not wish me to be dishonoured. Pity me,
madam, pity me.'"</p>

<p>"I was still standing; and bowing, I retired.
Mademoiselle de Orleans, (the
Princess Adelaide,) had not yet said anything.
She rose up, and retiring said,
'<em>I do not pity you, M. de Chateaubriand;
I do not pity you</em>.' I was forcibly struck
with the mournful accent with which she
pronounced these words."&mdash;Vol. ix. 361,
362.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Pity not me," said the dying
Chevalier Bayard to the traitor Constable
de Bourbon; "pity those who
fight against their king, their country,
and their oath." The feelings of
honour are the same in all ages.</p>

<p>We shall close this long line of
honourable acts with an extract from
Chateaubriand's noble speech in favour
of Henry V., in the Chamber of Peers,
on July 7, 1830.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Charles X. and his sons are dethroned
or have abdicated; it signifies not which.
The throne is <em>not vacant</em>&mdash;after them
comes an infant; will you condemn the
innocent?</p>

<p>"'What blood now cries out against
him? Can you say it is that of his father?
That orphan educated in the school of
his country, in attachment to a constitutional
throne, and in the ideas of his age,
will become a king in harmony with the
cravings of the future. It is to the
guardian of his infancy that you would
first tender the oath to be faithful to it.
Arrived at mature years, he would himself
renew it. The king at this moment,
the real king for a time, would be the
Duke of Orleans, the regent of the kingdom;
a prince who has lived near the
people, and who knows that the monarchy
now can only be a monarchy of concession
and reason. That combination, so natural,
so obvious, appears a main element in
reconciliation, and would save France
from the convulsions which are the consequence
of violent changes in a state.</p>

<p>"'To say that this infant, separated
from his masters, would not have leisure
to forget their precepts before becoming
a man: to say that he would remain infatuated
by certain dogmas of his birth,
after a long popular education, after the
terrible lesson which has discrowned two
kings in two nights: is that reasonable?</p>

<p>"'It is neither from a sentimental devotion,
nor the affection of a nurse for the
cradle of Henry IV., that I plead a cause
where all would turn against me if it
triumphed. I am neither influenced by
the ideas of romance nor of chivalry: I
do not desire the crown of martyrdom. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
do not believe in the divine right of kings:
I am alive to the power of revolutions,
and the evidence of facts. I do not even
invoke the charter: I ascend to a higher
source. I draw my principles from the
philosophic ideas of the age in which my
life expires: I propose the Duke of Bordeaux
simply as a necessity preferable to
the Duke of Orleans.</p>

<p>"'You proclaim the sovereignty of force.
It is well. <em>Look carefully after it: guard
it well; for, if it escapes you, who will
pity your lot?</em> Such is human nature.
The most enlightened minds are not always
raised above the temptations of success.
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprits forts</i> were the first to invoke
the right of violence; they supported
it by all the force of their talents; and at
the moment when the truth of what they
said is demonstrated by the abuse of that
force, and its overthrow, the conquerors
seize the weapon they have broken! Dangerous
trophies, which may wound the
hand which seized them.</p>

<p>"'A useless Cassandra, I have fatigued
the throne and the country sufficiently
with my disdained predictions: it remains
for me only to seat myself on the
remains of the wreck which I have so
often predicted. I recognise in misfortune
every power except that of absolving
us from our oaths. I must render my life
uniform: after all I have written, said,
and done for the Bourbons, I should be
the basest of the base if I deserted them
when for the third time they bend their
steps into exile.</p>

<p>"'Far from me be the thought of casting
the seeds of division into France:
thence it is that I have avoided in my discourse
the language of the passions. If
I had the firm conviction that an infant
should be left in the obscure and tranquil
ranks of life, to secure the repose of
thirty-three millions of men, I should have
regarded any opinion expressed against
the declared wishes of the age as a crime.
I have no such conviction. If I was entitled
to dispose of the crown, I should
willingly lay it at the feet of the Duke of
Orleans. But I have no such right. I
see no place vacant but a tomb at St Denis,
and not a throne.</p>

<p>"'Whatever destinies may attend the
lieutenant-general of the kingdom, I shall
never be his enemy, if he acts for the good
of his country. I only ask to be allowed
to preserve the freedom of my conscience,
and to go and leave my bones where I
shall find independence and repose. I
vote against the motion.'"&mdash;Vol. ix. 386-388.</p></blockquote>

<p>Chateaubriand was as good as his
word. He resigned all his appointments,
even his pension of £600 a-year
as Peer of France: he sold off
all his effects, which scarcely paid his
debts: he refused the offer of Charles
X. to restore that pension out of the
wreck of that Prince's own fortune: he
set out again penniless on the pilgrimage
of life: and till his death, in
1848, supported himself entirely by
his literary talents.</p>

<p>Such was honour in the olden time.
We do not say that it would not find
imitators, on a similar crisis, on this
side of the Channel: we believe it
would find many. But this we do say,
that it would find them only among
those who are imbued with the ancient
ideas, among whom, whether
patrician or plebeian, the spirit of chivalry
is not extinct. It will not be
found among the worshippers of mammon,
or the slaves of interest. Woe
to the nation by whom such feelings
are classed with the age of the mammoth
and the mastodon! It has
entered the gulf of destruction, for it

<h2>THE GREEN HAND.</h2>

<h3>A "SHORT" YARN.</h3>

<h4>PART XI.</h4>


<p>"Well, ma'am," continued our
narrator, addressing himself, as usual,
to his matronly relative in the chair,
and with the accustomed catch-word,
which was like the knotting together
of his interrupted yarn: "well&mdash;it
was between a fortnight and three
weeks after losing sight of St Helena,
that, being at last fairly in the latitude
of the Cape, the frigate and schooner
tacked in company, and stood close-hauled
on a wind to the eastward. By
the middle watch that night, when the
moon set, we could make out the long
flat top of Table Mountain heaving in
sight off the horizon over against her.
Next day, in fact, we were both of us
quietly at anchor outside of the shipping
in Table Bay; Cape Town glittering
along on the green flat amongst
the trees to southward, with the hills
on each side of it like some big African
lion lying on guard close by; while
Table Mountain hove up, square-shouldered,
blue to the left, four thousand
feet high, as bare and steep as a
wall, with the rocks and trees creeping
up from the foot, and the wreaths of
light cloud resting halfway, like nothing
else but the very breakwater of
the world's end. The sea stretched
broad off to north and west, and a
whole fleet of craft lay betwixt us and
the land&mdash;half of them Indiamen&mdash;amongst
which, you may be sure, I
kept a pretty sharp look-out with the
glass, to see if the Seringapatam were
there still.</p>

<p>I was soon saved further pains on
this head, however, when shortly
afterwards the frigate was beset by a
whole squadron of bumboats, shoving
against each other, and squabbling, in
all sorts of Nigger tongues, who should
be first: the chief of them being in
evident command of a fat old Dutch
Frouw, with an immense blue umbrella
over her, two greasy-looking
Hottentot rowers in blankets, and a
round-faced Dutch boy, the picture of
herself, steering the boat; as the old
lady made a clear berth for herself,
by laying about with her blue umbrella,
till she was close under our
quarter, sitting all the while with the
broad round stern of her bright-coloured
gown spread over a couple of beer-barrels,
like a peacock's train. In two
minutes more the little fellow was up
the side, flourishing a bundle of papers
under the first lieutenant's very nose,
and asking the ship's custom, even
whilst the sentries were ordering them
all off. A midshipman took this youth
by the cuff of the neck, and was handing
him rather roughly along to the
care of the purser's steward, when I
stepped betwixt them; and a bumboat
being the best directory on the point,
of course, I soon found the old lady
had had dealings with the Seringapatam,
which her bluff-built little progeny
described as a very good ship
indeed, all having paid their bills,
except one young officer, who had left
a balance standing, for which he had
given a letter to his brother in a ship
that was to come after. As for the
Indiaman herself, the Dutch boy said
she had sailed about a week before
our arrival, along with two others;
and he was anxious to know if we
were the vessel in question. I accordingly
unfolded the open letter,
which was addressed,&mdash;"Thomas
Spoonbill Simm, Esquire, of His Britannic
Majesty's ship Nincompoop,
(or otherwise;") and it ran somehow
thus:&mdash;"<em>Hon. East India Company's
ship Seringapatam, Table Bay, September
1, 1816.</em>&mdash;My dear Brother,
This is to certify, that I have eaten
four dozen and a half of eggs, supplied
by the worthy Vrouw Dulcken, the
bearer of this, whom I can recommend
as an old screw, and am due her for
the same the sum of nine shillings and
sixpence sterling, which you will
kindly pay her, taking her receipt or
mark, unless you are willing to forfeit
our family watch, herewith deposited
by me in the hands of said Mother
Dulcken. I may add that, in justice
to the worthy Vrouw, three of the
above-mentioned eggs ought to be
charged as <em>fowls</em>, which, by the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
I did not consume; and, with love to
all at home, remain your affectionate
brother, <span class="smcap">John Simm</span>, H. E. I. C. S.&mdash;<em>P. S.</em>
The watch I have discovered to
be pinchbeck, and it does not go; so
that a sad trick must have been originally
played upon our venerated
Uncle, from whom it descended. J. S."
This precious epistle was, without
doubt, a joke of the fat mid. Simm,
who used to come such rigs over Ford
the cadet, and that jumped overboard
one night by mistake out of the Indiaman's
quarter-boat, during the voyage.
As for the existence of his brother
Thomas, or the chance of his
touching at that port, I set them down
with the coming home of Vanderdecken;
though the thought of this
young scamp of a sea-lawyer breakfasting
for a fortnight so comfortably,
only a few feet distant from my charmer's
state-room, sent me all abroad
again, and right into the Indiaman's
decks, by this time far out of sight of
land. Piece of impudent roguery
though it was, I was actually loath to
part with the scrawl, which the reefer
had fisted, no doubt, on the lid of his
chest&mdash;probably with a pipe in his
mouth at the time, it smelt so of tobacco&mdash;only
seven days before. I could
even see the grin on his fat face as he
wrote it below in the steerage, with
his chin up, and his eyes looking down
past his pipe; while the little Dutch
boy's round flat frontispiece glistened
as he peered up at me, in the evident
notion of my being the brother expected.
In fact, ma'am, I was so
soft as to intend paying the nine-and-sixpence
myself, and keeping the
letter, when I was startled to see
the old lady herself had contrived to
be hoisted on board amongst her cabbages;
and having got wind of the
thing, seemingly, she came waddling
towards me to hand over Simm's
watch to boot. In another half
minute the letter was being read
aloud in the midst of the whole
gun-room officers, amongst roars of
laughter; the honest old Dutchwoman
holding aloft the precious article, and
floundering through to find out the
rightful owner, as every one claimed
it and offered the nine-and-sixpence;
while for my part I tried first to get
down one hatchway, then another,
and Lord Frederick himself came up
on the starboard side of the quarterdeck
in the height of the scene. Indeed,
I believe it was a joke for
months after in the Hebe, of a night,
to say it was "the second lieutenant's
watch;" the sole revenge I had being
to leave Mother Dulcken and her boy
to expect the "ship that was coming
after."</p>

<p>A Government boat came aboard
in the afternoon, and as soon as it
left us, Lord Frederick took his gig,
and steered for a frigate lying some
distance off, which had the harbour
flag hoisted at her main, being the
only man-o'-war besides ourselves,
and commanded by a senior captain.
Till it got dark I could see the crews
of the nearest merchantmen looking
over their bulwarks at us and our
prize, apparently comparing the
schooner with the frigate, and speculating
on her character, as she lay a
few fathoms off the Hebe's quarter,
both of us rising and falling in turn
on the long heave of the Cape swell
from seaward. 'Twas hard to say, in
fact, so far as their hulls went, which
was the most beautiful sample of its
kind; though the schooner's French-fashioned
sticks and off-hand sort of
rigging, showed rather like jury-gear
beside the tall regular sticks aloft of
the Hebe's decks, with all her hamper
perfect to a tee. The Hebe's men
very naturally considered their own
ship a model for everything that
floated, a sort of a Solomon's temple, in
short; and to hear the merciless way
they ran down the Indiamen all round,
would have raised the whole homeward-bound
fleet against us; whereas
the schooner was our own, at any
rate, and she was spoken of much in
the manner one mentions an unfortunate
orphan, as good as already christened
by the name of "the Young
Hebe." This our learned chaplain
said was quite improper, and he gave
another name in place of it&mdash;the
"Aniceta"&mdash;which meant, as he observed,
the Hebe's youngest daughter;
so the Aniceta she was called, happening
to be a title that went, according
to the boatswain, full as sweetly
through the sheave-hole.</p>

<p>Next day the schooner had landed
not only her passengers from St
Helena, but the prisoners also, as we
still understood the French and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Kroomen to be. Not long after that
Lord Frederick came back from Cape
Town, looking grave, and went
straight down to his cabin, or "cabins,"
as his lordship preferred to have it
said. The first lieutenant dined that
day with the captain; but they could
scarcely have finished when the
"young gentlemen" who had been as
usual from the reefer's mess, came up
with a message from the captain, that
his lordship would be glad if I would
join the first lieutenant and himself in
a glass of wine. I found them sitting
at the side of the table nearest the
open port, with the decanters between
them, and the broad bright bay in
full sight to the shore and the foot of
Table Mountain, which rose up blocking
the port with the top of it beyond
view; the sounds of the merchantmen
clicking at their heavy windlasses,
and hoisting in water-casks, floated
slowly in from every side, while the
schooner had hauled on her cable
more abreast of the frigate, leaving
the sight clear over the eddy round
her low counter.</p>

<p>"A lovely piece of workmanship,
certainly!" observed Lord Frederick
thoughtfully, as he leant back swinging
his eyeglass round his finger, with
the other hand in the breast of his
waistcoat, and looking out at what
was seen of the schooner. "And how
one might have improved her spars,
too!" said Mr Hall, wistfully. "I
should have recommended longer
lower-masts altogether, Lord Frederick,
and a thorough overhaul, I may
say, from the combings upwards!"
"I would not have her hull touched
for the world, Mr Hall!" said the
captain; "'tis too&mdash;excessively provoking,
at least! But pass the bottles
to Mr Collins, if you please." I had
taken a chair and quietly filled my
glass, wondering what could be the
matter, when his lordship turned to
me and said, "Do you know, Mr Collins,
this schooner of ours is likely to
be laid up in Chancery, heaven knows
how long. The Admiralty court ashore
are doubtful of condemning her, apparently,
and she must either be sent
home or to Monte Video or somewhere,
where the master of her claims
to belong!" "Indeed, my lord," said
I, setting down my glass, "that
is curious." "Curious indeed, sir!"
replied he, biting his lips, "though,
after all, we really can scarce say
what she is to be condemned for&mdash;only
in the meantime I sail to-morrow
for India." "She's French to
the backbone, that I'll swear, Lord
Frederick!" I said; "and what's
more, she was"&mdash;&mdash;"Ah," broke in the
captain, "I know, I know; but the
less we say of that, in present circumstances,
the better! Once get her
entangled with politics, and we may
give her up altogether." Lord Frederick
twisted his eyeglass round his
forefinger faster than before, still
watching the schooner; the first lieutenant
held up his claret betwixt himself
and the light, and I sipped mine.
"I tell you what, gentlemen," exclaimed
his lordship suddenly, "I
<em>must</em> have that schooner at any cost!&mdash;What
is to be done, Mr Hall?"
"She'd be of great service in the
China seas, my lord, certainly," said
the first lieutenant, looking thoughtfully
into his empty glass; "a perfect
treasure for light service, especially if
new sparred and&mdash;" I noticed Lord
Frederick glancing sideways at me, as
I thought, with a slight gleam in his
eye; and accordingly I suggested that
he might buy her from the Frenchman
himself; a very poor idea, no
doubt, as both the captain and first
luff seemed to think, and we all three
kept eyeing her doubtfully through
the port, without a word.</p>

<p>At this time the schooner's counter
had been slowly sheering toward the
frigate's beam, owing to the ebb-tide,
and her holding only by a single cable,
till her stern began to show right
opposite the cabin, I should say not
twenty feet off. Lord Frederick put
his glass to his eye, and was peering
through it, when he remarked that
they had brought up rather too near,
leaving scarce room for the schooner
to swing as she did, earlier than we,
so that she would be in danger of getting
foul of the frigate's cables. "The
worst of it is, Lord Frederick," said I,
"that in case of a gale from seaward
here, she might have to slip and run
upon very short warning, whereas the
Hebe has plenty of ground-tackle to
let her ride it out. Considering it
was Table Bay, at this season, he
ought to have kept her a clearer
berth for herself, or else have gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
well outside!"&mdash;"Ah!" said Lord
Frederick quickly, meeting my eye
for half a minute, till the gleam came
into his again; and somehow or other
mine must have caught it, though I
must say the notion that struck me
then all at once wasn't in my head
before. "Do you know, that's well
thought of, Collins!" said his lordship.
"You've weathered the Cape
before, by the bye?"&mdash;"A dozen times,
Lord Frederick," said I; when a
regularly jovial roar of laughter broke
fair through the port into the cabin,
from over the schooner's taffrail, as
she sheered end-on to the frigate's
quarter, and Lord Frederick leant
forward with the glass screwed into
his right eye to see along their decks,
which were covered aft with an awning
like the open gable of a tent at a
fair. "Singular!" said he; "by the
lord Harry, who or what can that be
Mr Hammond has got there?" Dangling
over the French schooner's taffrail
were to be seen the soles of two
immense boots, with calves and knees
to match, and a pair of tightish striped
trousers worked up more than half
way, 'till you saw the tops of the stockings;
just beyond the knees was the
face leaning back in the shade of the
awning and a straw hat together, out
of which a huge green cabbage-leaf
hung like a flap over one eye, while
the other kept gazing in a half-closed
sleepy sort of way at the sky, and
the red end of a cigar winked and
glowed in the midst of the puffs of
smoke lower down. The first lieutenant
started up shocked at the sight,
the noble captain of the Hebe sat with
his eyeglass fixed, between amusement
and wonder; for my own part,
when the voice of this same prodigy
broke all of a sudden on us out of the
awning, in a mixture of stuttering,
hiccuping, Yankee drawling, and puffs
at the cigar, 'twas all I could do to
hold on, with the knowledge of where
I was. "W<em>a</em>ll now, general," said
the American, as if he were talking to
some one aloft or in the sky, "ye-you're
qui-quite wrong&mdash;I ki-kick-calc'late
I've fit a deal more be-be-battles
than you have&mdash;I re-respect
you, Ge-Ge-General Washington; but
I ho-ho-hope you know who&mdash;hic&mdash;whom
I am!" Here Mr Daniel Snout,
who was in a state of beastly intoxication,
swayed himself up bodily into
the schooner's taffrail, and sat with
his arms folded, his long legs swinging
over the stern, and his head trying to
keep steady, as he scowled solemnly
aloft over the frigate's mizen-royal-masthead;
while the third lieutenant,
Mr Hammond, and the master's mate
he had aboard with him, could be
heard laughing at his back, as if they
had gone mad&mdash;Hammond being a
wild sprig of an Irishman, who would
go any length for a piece of fun.</p>

<p>Just then the American's one eye
lighted on the side of the frigate, till
it settled lazily on the port of the captain's
cabin: first he seemed to notice
Lord Frederick Bury, and then myself,
the first lieutenant having just
recovered himself enough to rush toward
the door to get on deck. Daniel
himself surveyed me scornfully for a
moment, then with a sort of doubtful
frown, and a gravity that passes me
to describe, unless by the look of an
old cock a-drinking&mdash;evidently trying
to recollect me. "Hallo, mister!"
shouted he suddenly, "you haven't
touched those <em>notions</em> of mine, I hope."
With that he made a spring off
where he sat, as if to come towards
us&mdash;no doubt thinking of the Seringapatam,
and the valuables he had left
aboard, without seeing the water between;
and a pretty deep dive Mr
Snout would have made of it, into an
ebb-tide that would have swept him
under the frigate's bottom, if Mr Hammond
and the midshipman hadn't both
sprung forward in time to catch him
by the neck of the coat. There, accordingly,
was the Yankee hanging
like a spread eagle over the schooner's
taffrail, yelling and turning round at
the same time like a fowl on a spit&mdash;the
third lieutenant's and the mate's
faces, two pictures of dismay, as they
held on, at finding for the first time
where the schooner had shied them
round to, with their two pairs of eyes
fair in front of the captain's eyeglass,&mdash;while
Mr Hall was singing out like
thunder from the deck above us,
"The schooner ahoy&mdash;d'ye see where
you've got to, sir; haul ahead on
that cable, d'ye hear, you lubbers,
and keep clear of the ship!"</p>

<p>"Mr Collins," said his lordship
quietly to me, as soon as he could keep
his countenance, and looking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
sterner for the trouble he was put to in
doing it, "you will get your things and
go aboard the schooner directly&mdash;take
her in charge, sir, and send Mr Hammond
back here."&mdash;"Very well, my
lord," said I, waiting in the doorway for
something more, which, from something
in Lord Frederick's look, I had reason
to expect, knowing it of old. "I can
only spare you a dozen of the men
she has," added he; "but if you choose
you can send ashore at once to pick
up a few makeshifts, or anything you
find!"&mdash;"Ay, ay, my lord," said I;
"the best hand for that would be Mr
Snelling, if I may take him, Lord
Frederick?" "Oh, certainly," was
the answer; "and harkye, Collins,
you had better shift your berth a few
cable-lengths farther off, or more, if
you please."&mdash;"One thing, my lord,"
said I, stooping down to see through
the port, "I don't much like the heavy
ground-swell that begins to meet the
ebb, Lord Frederick; and I fancy it
won't be long ere Table Mountain
spread its supper-cloth&mdash;in which case
I'd consider it necessary to slip cable
and run out at once, though I mightn't
get in again so easily. Am I to find
the frigate here again, Lord Frederick?"&mdash;"Deuce
take it, man&mdash;no!"
said his lordship. He turned his back
to hide the evident twinkle of his eye.
"Should we part company, of course
you make for the Bay of Bengal!
You can't be sure of the Hebe, short
of the Sandheads&mdash;and if not there,
then opposite Fort William, at Calcutta."&mdash;"Very
good, my lord," said
I, and had made my bow to go on
deck, when Lord Frederick called me
back. "By the bye," said he hastily,
"about that Indiaman of yours, Collins&mdash;she
is here, no doubt?" "No,
Lord Frederick," answered I, "I believe
she sailed a week ago." "Dear
me, the deuce!" exclaimed he, "why I
meant to have sent to-morrow to have
your friend Westwood arrested and
brought aboard!" I started at this, on
which his lordship explained that if
Westwood got to Bombay, whither the
Seringapatam was bound, the authorities
there would have news of the thing
by this time, and could send him overland
at once to England, which would be
far worse for him than being carried to
Calcutta, where his uncle the Councillor's
interest might do something for
him. "The best thing you can do,
Collins," added Lord Frederick, "if
you <em>are</em> obliged to run out to sea, is to
look after that Indiaman! With such
a neat thing of a sea-boat under you,
you might do anything you please;
so cruise to windward or leeward in
chase, find her out, and take out
Westwood bodily&mdash;lose him afterwards
in the Hoogley, if you like&mdash;carry
away those old spars of hers,
and send up new ones&mdash;only don't lose
the schooner, I beg; so good bye to
you, my dear fellow, lest we should
not meet on this side the Line again!"&mdash;"Good
bye, my lord!" said I cheerfully,
and hurried on deck, understanding
all he wanted as well as if I'd
been ordered to set her jib that
moment and heave up anchor. In
ten minutes I was over the frigate's
side, and in ten more Hammond was
back in her, with the men who were
to leave; while I sent my baggage
below, set the hands to work shifting
the schooner's berth, and by sun-down
we were lying beyond hail of the ship,
opposite the custom-house, and a long
line of a main street in Cape Town,
where we could see the people, the
carriages, and the Dutch bullock-carts
passing up and down; while Table
Mountain hove away up off the steep
Devil's Hill and the Lion's Rump, to
the long level line a-top, as blue and
bare as an iron monument, and throwing
a shadow to the right over the
peaks near at hand.</p>

<p>Our friend from the United States
being by this time in quite an oblivious
condition, the first thing I did was to
have him put quietly into the boat
with which Mr Snelling was to go
ashore for fresh hands, and I instructed
the reefer to get clear of him anyhow
he liked, if it was only above
tide-mark. When they were gone I
walked the schooner's little quarterdeck
in the dusk by myself, till the
half moon rose with a ghostly copper-like
glare over the hollow in the Lion's
Rump, streaking across the high face
of Table Mountain, and bringing out
all its rifts and wrinkles again. The
land-breeze began to blow steadily
with a long sighing sweep from the
north-east, meeting the heavy swell
that set into the broad bay; and the
schooner, being a light crank little
craft, got rather uneasy; whereas you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
could see the lights of the frigate
heaving and settling leisurely, less
than half a mile off. I had only six
or seven good hands aboard altogether
at the time, which, with those the
midshipman had, were barely sufficient
to work her in such seas; so
with all I had to do, with the difficulty
of getting men in the circumstances,
a long voyage before us, and
things that might turn up, as I hoped,
to require a touch of the regular service,
why the very pleasure of having
a command made me a good deal
anxious. Even of that I didn't feel
sure; and I kept watching Table
Mountain, eager for the least bit of
haze to come across the top of it, as
well as sorry I had sent Snelling
ashore. "I'd give a hundred pounds
at this moment," thought I, "to have
had Bob Jacobs here!"</p>

<p>As the moon got higher, I could see
the swell washing up between the different
merchantmen in sight, into
their shadows, and heavy enough
some of them seemed to roll round
their cables, betwixt a breeze and a
swell running the contrary ways;
first one let go a second anchor, and
then another, to help their heads
shoreward; but still there was no
danger, as things went. It wasn't
long before I made out two boats
coming from toward the town, round
the stern of one of the ships, the frigate
lying betwixt her and us, so that
they took her by the way, and a good
deal of hailing seemed to pass between
them. I could even see epaulets
glisten over the Hebe's quarter, as
if there was a stir made aboard;
after which the boats were plainly
pulling for the schooner. What
all this might mean, I couldn't very
well conceive, unless it were either
Snelling come back already, or
else some hands Lord Frederick
himself had provided before this, as
I saw both boats were full of people.
"Forward there!" I sung out, "hail
those boats!"&mdash;"Ay, ay, the schooner
ahoy!" was the answer, in a sharp
voice from the headmost of them,
"from the shore&mdash;all right! Stand
by to heave us a line, will ye?"
Next came a hail from Snelling, in
our own gig; so I at once gave orders
to heave them a rope and have both
boats brought under the gangway,
naturally supposing the sharp little
fellow had come some marvellous
good speed in shipping hands. As
soon as he jumped on deck, I accordingly
inquired how many men he had
brought, when to my great surprise
he informed me there was only one,
"a scuffy sort of a swab," as he
expressed it, "who would do for
cook!"&mdash;"The devil he will, you
young rascal," I broke out. "Hush,
sir, for heaven's sake," said he, making
some extraordinary sign which I
didn't understand; "it'll all be right
in the end, Mr Collins. Now then,
sir," to some one in the boat alongside,
as he carefully handed him the
accommodation-ropes, "here you are&mdash;hold
on, sir&mdash;so-o!" This was a
rather youngish fellow in a huge pilot
coat and a glazed cap, with some
kind of uniform inside, and a large
breastpin in his shirt, who handed me
a paper the moment he stood firm on
deck, without speaking a word;
though, by the light of the deck-lantern,
I didn't much like the look
of his foxy sort of face, with the
whiskers on it coming forward from
both cheeks to his mouth, nor the
glance he gave round the schooner
with his pair of quick sharp little
eyes. "Much more like a custom-house
officer than a cook!" thought
I, "unless we mean to have a French
one;" but what was my astonishment,
on opening the paper, to find
him called "Gilbert Webb, harbour-master's
assistant, hereby authorised
by the Admiralty Court, sitting in Cape
Town, to take charge of the doubtful
vessel described in her papers as the
'Ludovico,' belonging to Monte
Video&mdash;from the officer commanding
the prize crew of his Britannic
Majesty's ship Hebe." My first
thought was to have Mr Gilbert
Webb pitched over into his boat
again, when Lord Frederick's own
signature met my eye at the bottom
of the paper, addressed below to
"Lieutenant Collins, of his Majesty's
schooner Aniceta, <em>at sea</em>." A wonderfully
mysterious squint from Snelling,
behind the officer, was sufficient
to clinch the matter in my own mind,
showing that the reefer was as sharp
as a needle: and I handed back the
document to the harbour gentleman,
with a "Very well, sir, that will do."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
"I suppose I'd better have my men
up, Lieutenant Collins?" said he,
with a quick pert kind of accent,
which made me set him down at once
for a Londoner, while at the same
time he seemed impatient, as I
thought, to get the management.
"Why, sir," said I, "I suppose you
had."</p>

<p>Hereupon up mounted four or five
decent enough looking <em>stevedores</em><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>&mdash;one
or two of whom had rather the
air of sailors, the rest being broad-beamed,
short-legged Dutchmen,
with trousers like pillow-slips&mdash;followed
by a whole string of fourteen
or fifteen Indian Lascars, their bundles
in their hands, and an ugly old <em>serdug</em>
at their head; while the lame, broken-down,
debauched-like fellow of a
man-o'-warsman, that Snelling had
found sitting on a timberhead ashore,
got aboard with our own boat's crew.
Our gangway was chokeful, to my
fresh dismay, for to get rid of such a
tagrag-and-bobtail, in case of running
to sea, was impossible; even if
they weren't odds against us, here
was it likely to get a thick night, the
swell growing under the schooner till
she began to yerk at her anchor, head
to wind, like a young filly at a
manger; so that dropping them back
into their boat when needful, as I
intended at first, was out of the question
for the present. I found from
the harbour officer that the number
of hands would all be required with
the morning tide, when his orders
were to have the schooner towed in
opposite the Battery Dock, especially
as there was much chance of the
wind blowing strong from seaward
next day. The swell on the water,
he said, was such that, after putting
off, he thought of going back again
till the tide began to turn; if he had
not been encouraged to stick to it
and keep on by the midshipman,
whom he fell in with near the quay.
This piece of news was the finish to
the rage I felt brewing in me, vexed
as I naturally was to give up the
notion of a free cruise, in command
of a craft like the schooner; and, as
soon as Mr Webb was comfortable
in the cabin, over a tumbler of stiff
grog and some cold beef, I sent for
Snelling to my own cupboard of a
state-room.</p>

<p>"You cursed unlucky little imp
you!" I burst out, the moment he
made his appearance, "What's the
meaning of this, sirrah? eh?"&mdash;"What
is it, if you please, sir?"
said Snelling, pretending to hold
down his shock-head like a frightened
schoolboy, and looking up all the
time both at me and the lamp at
once, while he swayed with the
uneasy heave of the deck in such a
way as made me grip him by the
arm in a perfect fury, fancying he
had got drunk ashore. "You young
blackguard you!" said I, shaking
him, "didn't I tell you to get hands&mdash;didn't
you know I meant to&mdash;to&mdash;"
"Oh yes, Mr Collins," gasped the
reefer, "I did indeed&mdash;you meant to
cut and run&mdash;I saw it by your eye,
sir, and&mdash;don't shake me any more,
sir, or you'll spoil my hair&mdash;and I
don't deserve it&mdash;it's&mdash;all right!"
And on my letting him go, the ugly
little scamp sunk down on a chair
with his eyes starting from his head,
and a leer like a perfect demon incarnate;
but so perfectly laughable it
was, not to mention the air of complete
confidence between us that he
threw into it, that I sat down myself,
ready to grin at my bad luck. "Well,
Mister Snelling," said I, quietly,
"you <em>are</em> a touch beyond me! Let's
have the joke, at least&mdash;out with it,
man, else another shake may be&mdash;"
The reefer pointed with his thumb
over his shoulder to the cabin, shoved
his chin forward, and whispered,
"Why, sir, I'm only doubtful whether
you could make him third officer&mdash;but
at any rate, he'll always be useful
at a rope, Mr Collins&mdash;won't he,
sir?" I gave Snelling one look,
meant to be as grave as an Old
Bailey chaplain's, but it wouldn't do&mdash;my
conscience wouldn't stand it&mdash;in
fact the very self-same notion seemed
to me to have been creeping into my
mind. "You&mdash;young&mdash;rascal!" was
all I could manage to say, before
making bolt to go on deck. "By the
by, Mister Snelling," said I, turning
and looking down from the hatchway,
"you must want a glass of grog&mdash;tell
the boy to let you have some&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
go and keep the officer company,
sir."</p>

<p>By this time it was raining hard, the
half-moon coming out at moments and
shining through it with a sudden
sharp gleam, in some gust of the wind
off the land&mdash;showing the swell in as
far as the wet white custom-house and
the bare quays, the ships with their
hazy lights all hither and thither,
while Table Mountain was to be seen
now and then peering half over the
mist, first one corner and then another,
of a colour like dead ashes. One time
I looked down toward the dusky little
cabin, where the midshipman, quite
in his element, was sitting with the
harbour officer, the lamp jerking and
making wild swings betwixt them,
while Snelling evidently egged on his
companion to drink; then I gave a
glance seaward, where there was
nothing but a glimmer of rain and
spray along the dark hollows of the
water. I couldn't make up my mind,
all I could do&mdash;it was too barefaced a
thing to slip from the roadstead with
a breeze blowing off-shore; but the
worst of it was that I didn't feel easy
at the idea of parting with an anchor
in the circumstances, not to say carrying
off the Government people, unless
forced to it. I accordingly went below
to mix myself a stiffener, and found
the officer a cool head, for, in spite of
all Snelling could do, the reefer himself
had got provoked, whereas the sharp
Mr Webb was only a little brisker
than before. "A rough sort of night,"
said I, nodding to him, as I knocked
the water out of my cap. "Well, it
seems," said he, free and easy.
"S'pose I go on deck then, gentlemen&mdash;I've
refreshed, I assure you, so you
needn't trouble about this 'ere schooner
no farther&mdash;glad to get quit of it and
turn in, I desay, lieutenant?"&mdash;"No
trouble in the world, Mr Webb," said
I, going on with my mixture, "far
from it; but sit down a minute, pray
sir,&mdash;Mr Snelling here will take charge
of the deck for us in the meantime;"
and Snelling vanished at once, Mr
Webb apparently flattered at my wishing
his company. "Will that cable
of yours hold, think ye, Lieutenant
Collins?" asked he, filling up another
glass. "Why," said I, almost laughing,
"to tell you the truth, I begin to
feel devilish doubtful of it." "What!"
broke out the harbour officer, starting
up, "then I must 'ave another put
down immediately: why, what's the
effect, sir&mdash;we'll be carried out to
sea!" "You said it exactly, Mr
Webb," I said "'twould have been
much worse, I suppose, if we were
driven ashore, though! Now look
you, if I were to let go a second anchor
at present, I couldn't light upon
a better plan either to break her back,
or lose both anchors in the end&mdash;from
the difference of strain on the two
cables, with this ground-swell. The
fact is, my good fellow, you're evidently
not fit to take charge at
present." "D&mdash;n me, lieutenant!"
said he, looking fierce and foolish at
the same time, "here's strange lang'age
to a Gov'ment officer, sir&mdash;I
hask the meanin' off it <em>at</em> once, mister!"
"But I depend a good deal on your
knowledge of Table Bay weather," I
continued, leaning back with my
weather eye screwed to bear upon him.
"D'ye think this wind likely to moderate
soon, sir? come now."&mdash;"No,"
replied he sulkily: "I'm sure it won't&mdash;and
to-morrow it's certain to blow
back ten times worse." "Then, Mr
Webb," said I, rising, "you oughtn't
to have come aboard to-night; as the
short and the long of it is, I shall get
the schooner an offing the first possible
moment!" The officer stared at
me in a bewildered manner; and as
for the schooner, she seemed to be
bolting and pitching in a way worse
than before, with now and then a
plunge of the swell on her broadside
as if she had been under weigh. Suddenly
Snelling lifted the skylight frame
and screamed down into the cabin,
"Mr Collins, Mr Collins! she's been
dragging her anchor for the last ten
minutes, sir!"</p>

<p>I sprang on deck at two bounds&mdash;the
schooner had somehow or other
got her anchor out of hold at the time,
the cable as taut as a fiddle-string.
It was quite dark aloft, and
not a vestige of Table Mountain to
be seen, though the moonshine, low
down to westward, brought out two or
three tracks of light along the stretch
of water, and you saw the lights in
the ships slowly sweeping past.
Where we happened to be, it blew
two ways at once, as is often the case
in Table Bay, round the bluffs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
mountain, and as soon as she brought
up again with a surge at the windlass,
the heave of a long swell took her
right on the quarter, lifting her in to
her anchor again with a slack of the
hawser, at which every second man
sung out to "hold on!" Over she
went to port, a sea washing up the starboard
side, and throwing a few dozen
bucketfuls at once fair into the companion,
where our friend the harbour
officer was sticking at the time; so
down plumped Mr Webb along with
it, and the booby hatch was shoved
close after him, while the poor devils
of Lascars were huddled together as
wet as swabs in the lee of the caboose
forward. "A hand to the wheel!"
shouted I, as soon as I recovered myself;
when to my great surprise I saw
Snelling's new hand, poor creature as
I'd thought him, standing with a
spoke in each fist, as cool and steady
as possible, and his eye fixed on me
in the true knowing way which I felt
could be trusted to. "Jib there!" I
sung out, "see all clear to run up a
few hanks of the jib&mdash;stand by to cut
the cable at the bitts!"&mdash;"Ay, ay,
sir," answered Snelling, who was
working away with the harbour men,
his bare head soaked, and altogether
more like an imp than a young gentleman
of the navy&mdash;"All's clear, sir."</p>

<p>Five minutes I dare say we stood,
every one in the same position, while
I waited for a good moment in the
run of the swell, looking into the
binnacle: till she hung slack, as it
were, in a wide seething trough of the
sea, when I signed to the man behind
me to put the helm gradually to starboard.
I glanced at the fellow again,
caught his sharp weatherly eye once
more&mdash;then putting both hands to my
mouth I sung out to bowse on the jib
halliards. "Now&mdash;cut&mdash;the cable!"
shouted I, springing forward in my
anxiety. The schooner rose away
from her anchor on the heavy roll of
the sea; I saw two quick strokes of
the axe on the instant, and she was
spinning head off from the wind, heeling
over betwixt the force of it and
the ground-swell together, while the
mass of black water was washing
bodily away with us; the new helmsman
showing down below me as he
leant to the wheel, like somebody at
the foot of a slide. If he hadn't
helped her at the moment with a back
turn of the spokes to port, t'would
have been all up with us. As it was,
the schooner fell off gallantly in his
hands, with a sliding surge into the
lee of the next swell, that buried her
sharp bows in the green sea, till it
foamed about our very shoulders as
we hung on like grim death to the
weather bulwark. She was just
shaking herself free, and rising like a
buoy over the broad tops of the waves,
when Snelling, myself, and two or
three of the men, staggered down to
her mainmast to swig up the throat
halliards, letting her feel a little of the
boom mainsail; and we had scarce
belayed, as the last glimpse of the
frigate's lights was caught astern of
us, heaving and setting, as she rode
with her two bower anchors down;
we had driven past close enough to
have heard the creak of her hamper
aloft. After that, I had the fore-stay-sail
set on her, then the reefed mainsail,
and the lively schooner yielded
to the long rolling seas so well, as
very soon to make her own weather
of it&mdash;especially since, clear of the
high land about Table Bay, it was
blowing only a strong breeze, and the
more I began to feel master of her,
the more inclined I was to let her
show her good qualities. Such a craft
I never had had the full management
of before in my life; and you may
easily fancy how I felt at dividing the
hands into the two watches, giving
little Snelling command of one, as first
mate, and picking out our men in
turn. I looked round amongst mine,
rather at a loss for one to make second
mate for the cruise, though there were
three prime enough man-o'-warsmen,
and I had chosen one of the Government
officer's gang for his activity.
As for the Lascars, we slumped in
half of the number to each of us, for
make-weights&mdash;when Snelling's fresh
hand, who had fallen to my share,
caught my eye again as he stood at
the wheel. Every half spoke he gave
the schooner told; she was topping
the heavy seas as they rose, and taking
them just where they melted one to the
other, with a long floating cleave, that
carried her counter fairly free of the
after-run, though nearly right before
the wind: the main-boom had been
guyed over to the lee-quarter, till a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
third of the sail hung clear of her hull,
and the breeze swept into the hollow
of it, thick with spray. The light from
the little binnacle shone up distinctly
on the man's face, and with all the
desperate, used-up, marbled sort of
look of it, like one getting the better
of a long spree ashore, I thought there
was something uncommonly promising
about him, not to say greatly above
the run of foremast men. The wet,
the wind, and the work he was at, took
off the seediness of his clothes; even
the old rag of a handkerchief round
his hairy neck had got a gloss to it,
and he stood handling the wheel with
a strange mixture of recklessness and
care, as he glanced from the compass
to the gaff of the mainsail against the
scud, and down again. The very
contrast between the man's manner
and his outward rig was sufficient to
strike one, though plenty of seamen
are to be found in the like state
ashore: but what fixed me to him
above all, was the expression in those
two keen, searching, <em>living</em> eyes of his,
when they once or twice met mine on
their way from aloft to the compass-boxes.
'Twas as if they'd woke up
since he came aboard out of a sleepy,
maudlin condition, with the "blue-devils"
or scarce fully out of 'em; like a
sick man's in the lull of a fever, suddenly
seen watching you out of the
dusk of the bed, when one happens to
glance up from the nurse's seat.</p>

<p>"What's your name, my man?"
asked I, stepping aft to the binnacle.
"My name is Jones, sir," said he
readily. "And your first name?"
I said. "Jack," was the answer, in
an off-hand way, with a hitch of one
shoulder, and a weather-spoke to the
wheel; spoken in an accent you'd
have expected more in a West End
drawing-room than from a common
sailor. "Ah," said I, sharply, "Jack
Jones? I wonder how many Jack
Joneses there are afloat! An able
seaman, I think, Jones?"&mdash;"Why
sir," replied the man, "I never rate
myself, sir&mdash;'tis all one to me, able,
ordinary, landsman, or boy&mdash;I carry
no papers, and leave my betters to
rate me." "Where were you last,
my man?" I asked; whereupon I met
such a cool, steady, deep look out of
the fellow's strange light-coloured
eyes, bloodshot as they were with
drinking, that I felt almost our very
two souls jostle in it: as much as to
say, To all eternity fathom me if ye
can! "Well, I forget where, sir," said
he, lowering his look to the compass-box
again: "always the way with me,
after a trip, a cruise, a voyage, or
whatever it may be. I've got&mdash;ha!"
and he yielded his body coolly to a
jerk of the schooner's wheel. "A sweet
craft this, sir, but a little ticklish!"
"You've got what?" said I, not unwilling
to wear out the time. "I've
got&mdash;no memory!" Still there
was somewhat so gloomy and mournful
in the next glance aloft, I
don't know how it was, but I
felt inclined to offer him a mate's
place on trial, and so I hinted, if he
knew half as well how to handle a
craft as he did of steering her. To my
own surprise, Jones's wonder didn't
seem to be roused at the notion, except
that he gave me another quick
glance from head to foot, with a queer
smile that struck me as if I were
being questioned, instead of <em>him</em>; then
he looked down over his own outfit,
judging by which you'd have said
he'd been shipwrecked. "Well,"
said I, "I daresay you've been hard
put to it, somehow, Jones,&mdash;so as
soon as you leave the wheel, you can
go below to the steward, and get a
seagoing suit of my own, till we see
Calcutta, when your mate's wages
will set you all right again." The
man touched his battered old straw
hat; but I noticed his eyes gleam for
a moment by the binnacle light, and
a strange twitch run round his mouth
at the mention of the mate's wages:
the only way I could account for it at
the time being his late hard-up condition;
and nothing to my mind was
more deucedly pitiable, than to see
the thought of a few paltry additional
rupees light up a head like that, with
the glistening sort of expression of a
miser, as I fancied. The man had a
head on him, in fact, when you eyed
him, fit for a gentleman's shoulders,
or more&mdash;his hair and his whiskers
curly and dark, draggled though they
were with the rain, not to say Cape
Town mud&mdash;while the wearing away
of the hair about the temples, and the
red grog-streaks in the veins of his
face, made him no doubt a dozen
years older to appearance than he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
was. For my part I was quite convinced
already, this same Jack Jones
hadn't been sent out a cabin boy; there
was not only a touch of high blood in
him at bottom, but I'd have sworn he
had been some time or other in the place
of a gentleman, afloat or ashore, though
plainly now "going to the devil."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the breaking look of the
clouds away on our larboard bow
showed it wasn't far off dawn; so,
sending another hand to the wheel,
and finding a snug spot under a stern-grating
for a snooze on deck, I told
Jones to begin with taking charge of
the deck for me. "One thing, sir,"
said he, touching his hat again, as I
lay down, "I've only shipped for the
outward voyage, and leave at the
first port."&mdash;"Why, what the deuce!"
said I, lifting my head; "what do
you mean to do there, eh?" "I&mdash;I
want to go ashore," answered he,
eagerly; "ay, if we're years on the
cruise, so much the better, sir,&mdash;but
so soon as she drops anchor off Calcutta,
I'm my own master?"&mdash;"Have
your own way, then," said I; "at
any rate I'll try you in the meantime,&mdash;so
Mister Jones, let's see how you
mind the schooner till eight bells!"
Whereupon I turned myself over to
sleep, and it was as broad daylight
as we had any likelihood of about the
Cape, when I woke.</p>

<p>It still blew a stiff breeze, but the
waves rose with a length and a
breadth in them you find in no other
sea; deep-blue sparkling hills of
water, with green gleams about the
crests, of which every single wave had
a hundred or so; and a long seething,
simmering, glassy hollow of a still
valley between, where the flecks of
foam slid away glittering out of the
shadow. But, Lord! it was glorious
to feel the schooner rising quietly in
the trough, with the mount of a
wave, to the very ridge of it; then
with a creak of all her timbers and
bulk-heads below, a slight shake to
windward, and a yerk at her bows,
lean over to leeward again and go
hissing through the breast of a huge
sea, till you thought she'd go down
into it; while there she was, however,
lifting head up, with a swift
flash of her cutwater, on the cross
half wave that joined every first and
third one&mdash;"billow" and "sea," as
you may say. The breeze having
drawn more easterly toward morning,
Jones had braced her more upon a
wind, with reefed main and foresails,
and fore-staysail set, which brought
out the Aniceta's weatherly qualities
to a marvel; as notwithstanding
almost a head-wind and a swelling
sea, she went nearly as fast as the
frigate would have done before the
breeze, and not a sign of the land
was to be seen from her crosstrees.</p>

<p>It was not till the afternoon, when
the midshipman and I had both been
busy together seeing various things
done about the rigging, as well as
having preventer-braces and guys
clapped on the booms and gaffs, that
we had time to look about us; the
schooner still driving along with the
breeze strong abeam, and a floating
plunge from one wide dark-blue sea
to another, as if they handed her
onward. Jones had got himself made
decent below, as I told him, till what
with different clothes and a shave
together, besides refreshment from
sea weather, he was quite a different
man to look at. Even Snelling owned
to his sailor-like appearance, though
rather surprised at my notion of making
him a mate; while as for the men,
they didn't know but he had come
aboard as such, and to tell the truth,
he was having the mainstaysail got
up and ready to bend at the time,
like one accustomed to give orders.
By this time I remembered the harbour
officer, Webb, whom we'd
carried off so unceremoniously, and
found he was still in his "bunk"
below, half sulky and half sick, consoling
himself with brandy and water
till we should get into Table Bay
again, as he said. "Only put him
into my watch, Mr Collins," said
Snelling gravely, "and I'll work him
up, sir." The reefer himself, in fact,
had all of a sudden turned out in a
laughably dignified style, to meet his
new post&mdash;in full midshipman's rig,
dirk and all, with his cocked hat,
which I sent him down immediately
to change; but he had brushed up his
mop of hair, and begun to cultivate
the down on his upper lip; while being
a deep-shouldered, square-built, short-armed
little fellow, as muscular as a
monkey, you'd have thought from the
back of his coat he was a man cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
shorter, and for his face, he had contrived
to put such a sour effect into it&mdash;meant
for great experience, no doubt&mdash;that
it was only by his eyes one saw
he was a boy of sixteen or so; and
<em>they</em> were brimful of wild glee, as he
jumped about wherever he was needed,
doing the work of a couple of ordinary
men, and actually delighted when a
spray came over the weather bulwarks
on top of him, seeing that,
instead of the frigate, she was "our
schooner" that did it.</p>

<p>"I think she walks, Mr Collins!"
observed Snelling, holding up his
head stiffly, and looking aloft as we
went aft, after shaking ourselves from
one of these same sprays. "No
denying that, Mr Snelling," said I as
gravely; "I only wish your fond
parents could see you just now, first
mate of such a smart craft, Mister
Snelling!" His father was a country
baronet, who had sent him off to sea
with an allowance&mdash;I daresay because
his looks were no ornament, and there
were plenty more coming; though
Snelling always pretended his worthy
progenitor was an old man. "Fond
be blowed!" said he, starting; "I
just see him at this moment at the
foot of that blessed old mahogany,
proposing my health before the ladies
go, and&mdash;" Here the schooner rose
on a sharp, short wave, making a
plunge through it that sent the helmsman
swinging to the lee-side of the
wheel, while a sea washed up over
her forecastle, and away aft with the
tubs, buckets, and spars, knocking
everybody right and left. Snelling
and I held on by the weather main-rigging
with our feet in a bath, till
she lifted bodily through it, careering
to her lee-gunnel. "By George,
though!" broke out the reefer, smacking
his lips as we drew breath, "I
wish he <em>did</em> see me&mdash;wouldn't it
cheer his declining years, when I'd
got to hand the governor carefully
below! And such a rough night as
we're going to have of it, too, sir!"
"You unfilial young dog!" said I;
"but so I'm afraid we shall&mdash;and no
joke either!" Jones was standing
near us, watching the looks of the
weather with evident uneasiness, and
I asked him what he thought of it.
"In my opinion, sir," said he,
"you'll have some pretty sudden
shift of wind ere long, of a kind I
have seen more than once off the
Cape before&mdash;and that as furious as
a south-easter ordinarily is hereabouts.
Look away yonder, sir!"</p>

<p>It had got to a clear, dry, north-easterly
gale, that shook our canvass
every time she lifted, singing through
the ropes, and bitter cold. Long and
heavy as the roll of the sea was, the
sky was as keen and clear as glass all
round about and aloft, save the mist
kicked up by the spray off a wave
here and there. If a rag of white
cloud appeared, it was blown away,
and you saw the black wrinkled side
of one wave at a time, a mile wide,
you'd have said, freckled all over
with spots of foam, and its ridge
heaving against the eye of the blast.
The waves had begun to break shorter.
The schooner, buoyant as she was,
and sharp as a dolphin, pitched and
rolled at times like mad, and the men
forward were standing by to let go
the fore-halliards, throat and peak, to
ease her a little: when Jones pointed
out the bank of gray cloud ahead of
us, scarce to be seen through the
troughs of the water, except when
she lifted well upon a swell of sea.
The sun going down in a wild red
glare to leeward of us, threw a terrible
glitter across the huge slant of
one single wave that rose stretching
away far and wide from her very
bow, then brought out the sulky
wrinkled blue in it; the hissing green
crests curled over to the very sunset,
as it were, while we sunk slowly into
the long dark lulling trough, and saw
the broken shaft of a rainbow stand
glimmering for a moment or two into
a black hollow right ahead, when
the gale drove it back upon us like an
arrow, as the schooner urged through
the breast of the next wave. I looked
from Snelling to the new mate, who
still held on by a belaying-pin and
watched the clouds, giving me back a
glance that showed he thought the
matter more serious than ordinary.
"The sooner we strip her to the
storm-staysails," said I quickly, as we
fell into the trough again, "the better,
I think. If it blows harder, we
must lie-to with her at once." My
eye was anxiously fixed on Jones,
for large as the schooner was, between
two and three hundred tons, yet no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
craft in the world is so nice to bring
to the wind in a gale, with a heavy
sea running. Scudding before it might
have done for the frigate, with her
full bows, and spars high enough to
keep her main-topsail full in spite of
the troughs; but even that would
have taken us out of our course after
the Indiaman. Besides that, to tell
the truth, I didn't sufficiently understand
fore-and-aft rigged craft in all
weathers yet, to be quite sure of what
I did at a pinch like the present.
"Yes, yes, sir," answered he; "but if you'll
take an older man's advice,
before that you'll wear her round on
the other tack to it. We've the
worst to come, or else I'm mistaken,
sir."&mdash;"You're accustomed to
schooners?" asked I firmly, and
gazing him in the face. I saw his
lips open in the sweep of the wind
through our after-rigging, and he
made a sign with his hand, while a
gnawing sort of spasm, as it were,
shot through the muscles of his jaw,
and for a moment he gave me a
devilishly fierce, keen glance, almost
a glare, from under his strong straight
eyebrows&mdash;then turned away. "Take
the trumpet then, Mr Jones," said I,
singing out into his ear; "I'll leave
her to you, sir. Mr Snelling, let's
see the hatches all fast!" And we
scrambled along by the belaying-pins.</p>

<p>"Are you all ready fore and aft?"
came Jones's voice like thunder in
the next dip she made, and he leapt
up bareheaded on the breech of one
of the small carronades aft, holding on
with one hand by the weather main-shrouds,
and watching the run of the
waves as they glimmered off our lee-beam
into the dusk, for full five
minutes. I had hold of a rope near
him, and his eye was as steady as if
he were picking out hills in a view.
I had full confidence in the man; but
I must say it was a nervous moment
to me, when I saw him lift the trumpet
to his mouth&mdash;and furiously as
the wind shook the schooner, you
heard his hoarse cry, "Put your
helm up&mdash;slack off the mainsheet&mdash;brail
up the mainsail&mdash;ease down the
weather boom-guy&mdash;main-staysail
sheet&mdash;" And the rest was lost in
the wild shriek of the north-east gale.
We were hard at it, however, staggering
as we hauled and held on,
even to the poor half-drowned, terrified
Lascars, whom the midshipman
had roused out of the caboose
and long-boat, shoving the ropes into
their leathery hands. But I knew little
else till I saw the schooner had payed
off before the wind, shearing with a
hiss like red-hot iron right through
the ridge, betwixt two tremendous
combing waves. It swelled green over
her larboard bulwark as she heeled
over, and she gave a heavy dead lurch
with it, as if she would let the next
sea break aboard. "Now! now!"
shouted Jones, at a pitch of voice like
no earthly sound; "aft the mainsheet,
for your lives!" He jumped to the
wheel himself, at a single bound. We
were in two floundering heaps, as we
dragged at the mainboom aft, and the
head-sheets on the forecastle, while
she came trembling up in the long
bight of the sea, and took the gale
steadily before her other beam. It
was blowing harder than ever; and
the awful "scud" of the sea rolled
her bodily away, as she met it with
her weather-bow, washing white over
the headrail, with spray from cathead
to bowsprit; the gale heaving her
down on the lee-beam, till she plunged
to the brim on that side, at every forward
pitch, so that all hands on deck
had to keep crowded together aft.
Still it was keen starlight overhead,
the gale dry, though it was bitter cold,
and the seas long and pretty regular.
The schooner behaved wonderfully,
being as tight as a bottle; and at the
same time we were not only lying our
course either for the Mozambique or
Indian Ocean, but instead of running
farther into the gale, as before, and
getting more into the wild Cape latitudes,
why, at present she tended to
clear out of them. I accordingly
agreed with Jones to hold on with
everything as long as possible, in spite
of the way she was sometimes flung
off with the crest of a wave, as it were,
making a clear dive with her nose
under water through a white seething
sea that seemed to swell round the
whole horizon: the black bank of
cloud off our weather-beam towered
like icebergs against the cold green
sky to south-east, the stars glittering
and twinkling over it, with little hazy
rings round them, after a fashion that
one of us liked no more than the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>About midnight, we had got everything
off her to the two small storm-staysails,
main and fore, the wind
blowing great guns, and the half moon
shining right over the long bank, as if
the back of it were dead-white; while
betwixt it and the washing glimmer
of moonlight half-way, you'd have
thought the black heave of the ridges
vanished into a bulk of shadow ten
times blacker, save for the heads of
spray tossing dimly over in it here
and there. All at once, in the very
height of the gale, as the black floating
clouds from the bank began to
cross over the gray scud flying fast
aloft, a blue flash of lightning shot
zig-zag into the very comb of a wave
ahead of us, then came the clap of
thunder, loud enough to be heard
above the wind, and in half a minute
there was a sudden lull. You saw the
fleecy rags of scud actually settling
together under the dark vapour moving
above them, and heard nothing
but the vast washing welter of the billows
rising and seething for miles
round, as if the world were water,
while the schooner rolled helplessly
away, with her storm-staysails flapping,
into the trough. The midshipman
almost gasped as he looked to
me&mdash;not from fear, but as much as to
say, "What next?" Our strange
mate stood against the fife-rail of the
mainmast, apparently too intent on
the sky and sea for speaking. For my
own part, I let go of my belaying pin,
and half tumbled to the wheel, almost
knocking the sailor down in my haste
to put the helm hard up&mdash;for I saw
how the blast was to come, fairly before
the beam, upon us. "Hard a-starboard
with it!" shouted I; "haul
down the main-staysail there&mdash;let her
fall off as she rises!" The last words
were never heard, for next moment
there was another flash of lightning,
this time a blaze all round into the
troughs of the sea; I saw a body of
mist coming down upon us from
south-east, through which the gale
struck her on the starboard beam,
having suddenly shifted eight points or
so. The heavy rolling swell from
north-east was close aboard, and as
soon as I knew what I was about,
here she was leaning over to the full
tremendous force of the storm, without
power to surge ahead, though
struggling to rise like a cart-horse down
on his knees with a load uphill of him.
'Twas by instinct, as they say, I found
myself scrambling along to her weather
main-channels, where I managed
to get out on the side, slippery as it
was, and drenched with the blinding
showers of spray. I had got my knife
at work, cutting the lanyards of the
shrouds to let the mainmast go, when
I saw Snelling creep after me, like a
fearless little fellow as he was, dirk in
hand; although what was come of
Jones I couldn't see, unless he had
lost heart and skulked. All at once,
to my great joy, the main-staysail
blew inway to leeward out of the bolt-ropes,
like a scrap of paper, the main-topmast
crashed at the cap and went
alongside, when the schooner righted
to her keel, with a wild bolt forward
through the whole width of an immense
wave&mdash;one of the "third waves" it
was, commonly the last and the hugest
in a single roll of the sea of the Cape,
before you sink into a long gliding
valley, with a sort of a lull in it. The
scene was so terrible at the moment,
though we bore up for full half a
minute to the fair steady stroke of the
awful gale, nothing but a yeast of
mist, scud, and darkness ahead, the
spray torn off the ridge of the wave
and flying with us, while the triple
run of the heavy seas astern was in
danger of sweeping her decks from
over the poop&mdash;that I felt we must
try lying-to with her at once. Indeed,
Snelling and I hardly knew whether
we were holding on or not, as we were
half washed inboard and half crawled
round the rigging; but Jones had
already seized the exact point, when
she sank in the hollow, to have the
helm eased down to leeward. Meanwhile
he had got the reefed foresail
balanced and set, with the sheet hauled
aft beforehand&mdash;a tackle hooked on to
the clue, and bowsed amidships&mdash;everything
else was off her; and with
this sail she came slowly up close to
the wind on the slant of the next
wave, lying-to nearly head toward the
force of the sea, as her helm was kept
fast, two or three points to leeward.
I never had seen a craft of the kind
hove-to in a gale before, and a very
nice matter it is, too. We drew
breath, scarce able to credit our eyes,
while the schooner rode apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
safe on a sea rolling mountain-high;
rising and falling off from the breasts
to the sides of the waves, so far as
leeway went, and forging ahead a
little at the same time through the
fierce spray that showered out of the
dark over her weather-bow.</p>

<p>Cape weather as bad I had seen
before, but always in good-sized
ships; and I owned to Snelling I
would rather have handled any one of
them, even with a lee-shore near, ten
times over, than this schooner of ours
in the present case. However, none
of us were in any mood for speaking
at the time, let alone the waste of
breath it was. The best thing we had
to do, after getting somewhat satisfied
of her weathering it this way,
was to have the grog served out to
the men, swig off a stiff pannikin one's
self, and make one's self as comfortable
as possible with his pea-coat in
the lee of something. The sight of
the sea ridging up with a dim glimmer
against the dark, kept your eye
fixed to it: first you thought it would
burst right aboard, crash down upon
the decks; then she lifted with it,
swelling broad under her, while the
long steady sweep of the gale drove
just over the bulwarks with a deep
moan: for half a minute, perhaps, a
shivering lull, when you heard the
bulkheads and timbers creak and
strain below from stem to stern, and
the bilge-water yearning, as it were,
to the water outside. Then, again, it
was a howl and a shriek, a wide
plunge of sea bore up her weather-bow,
and the moment ere she came
fairly to, one felt as if the schooner
were going to pitch God knows
where. Her whole bulwarks shook
and shivered, the wind found out
every chink in them, whistling round
every different rope it split upon,
while all the time, the loose wet
dreary spars behind the long-boat
kept slatting and clattering against
each other in the lashings, like planks
in a woodyard of a November night.
This was the way we stuck till the
morning watch showed it all in a
drizzling, struggling sort of half
light, blowing as hard as ever, the
Cape seas rolling and heaving mountain-high,
of a pale yesty hue, far and
wide to the scud; the spray drifting
from the crests, and washing over her
bare forecastle, with now and then
the white wings of a huge albatross
to be seen aslant to windward, riding
on the breast of a long wave down
into the trough.</p>

<p>Well, the whole blessed day did
this sort of thing continue, only varied
by now and then a huger sea than
ordinary lifting close aboard of us,
and we being hove up to get a glimpse
of the long glaring streak of horizon
through the troughs of the waves:
sometimes an unluckier splash than
usual over the bow and through the
forechains, that made us look sharp
lest the canvass of the foresail should
go, or the schooner broach end-on to
the sea. Otherwise, all we had to
do was to watch the binnacle, hold
on with one hand to a rope, and with
the other to our caps; or turn out and
in with each other down the booby-hatch
for a snatch of sleep, and a bit
of biscuit and cold beef, with a glass
of grog. Mr Webb, the harbour
officer, was to be seen below in his
berth all this time, lying as peaceable
as a child&mdash;whether he was dead sick,
or only confoundedly afraid, I didn't
know; but I must say I felt for the
poor fellow when I heard him ask
Snelling, in a weak voice, if he would
get somebody to stand off the bull's-eye
in the deck over his berth, as it
always made him think there was a
new hurricane coming on. "D&mdash;n
it, you low skulking hound!" said
the reefer, who had wonderfully little
pity in his make, "it can't be worse&mdash;what
d'ye want light for, eh?"
"Only to see the opposite wall,"
said Webb, meekly; "do, sir&mdash;oh
now!" "Oh, you lubber ye!" said
Snelling, "don't you know a bulkhead
from a wall yet? If you'd come on
deck to bear a hand like others, you
wouldn't need light; and <em>I</em> thought
you might do for a mate aboard, too&mdash;pah,
you scum!" "Mr Snelling,"
said I sharply, as he came through the
cabin, "a worm will turn when it's
trod upon, and so you may find yet,
sir!" "Well, Mr Collins," said he,
as confidentially as if I hadn't meant to
give him a set down, "I don't like the
fellow's eye. I'll look after him,
sir!" Not to mention the young
rogue's power of face, which was
beyond brass, he had a way of seeing
you in two places at once with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
upward squint of his, as if his eyes
were the points of a pair of compasses,
that made the officers of the
Hebe always send him to the masthead
directly, for fear it should take
the frown out of them. In fact, when
Snelling's twinkling weather-eye
lighted on one's neck, without the
other, you almost felt it tickle you,
and as usual I turned away with a
"pshaw!"</p>

<p>On the second morning, the gale at
last began to break, shifting southward;
on which, as soon as the sea
ran a little easier, I had the helm
cautiously put up at a favourable
moment, the reefed mainsail, fore-topmast-staysail,
and square fore-topsail
set as she got before the
wind, and away the schooner went;
rising on the wide deep-blue swells
with a long roll in them, then shearing
ahead through their breasts,
wrinkled and seething pale-green, till
she sank with the fall of the wave&mdash;the
stump of her aftermast standing,
and the fore one shortened by the
to'gallant-mast. You may easily believe
there was no one aboard more
eager to get clear of this weather than
myself; as in ordinary circumstances,
with a craft like this, in two or
three days more we might have been
in a high enough latitude to begin
looking out for the Indiaman. For
my part, I can't deny that the wish
for having Tom Westwood safe out of
harm's way, and with me in the
schooner, strong as it was, played
second to the notion of seeing sweet
Violet Hyde in any way again, if it
was only the last time before she
went out of reach altogether; for her
getting amongst East India ways of
doing, high-flying civilians and soldiers,
shows, and sights, either in
Calcutta or up-country, was equal to
anything else, in my mind. Still, we
had six or seven days longer of the
heavy seas and hard gales, before
north-easting enough could be made
to take us beyond the Cape winter,
just then coming on, and which the
Seringapatam had very likely escaped
by two or three days, so that she
would have a considerable start of us.</p>

<p>By this time we were standing well
up for the Mozambique Channel,
which I had heard the Indiamen
intended to take in company; a piece
of information that made me the more
anxious to overtake the Seringapatam,
at latest, by the time they
reached open water again, where,
being the only ship from Bombay, she
would no doubt part from her consorts.
We had a cruiser that year, as I knew,
in the Mozambique, where there were
some rumours of pirates after the war,
so that in case of her happening to
speak the Seringapatam close, and
having got any word of Westwood's
affair, he ran a chance of being picked
off. However, that wasn't by any
means the thing that troubled me
most: somehow or other, whenever
the picture of Violet's face brought the
Indiaman's decks clear into my mind,
with all about her, I couldn't get
rid of the notion that some ill-luck
would come across that ship before
she got into port. If any pirate craft
were to dodge the whole bevy of
Indiamen up the head of the channel,
as was pretty sure to be the case, he
would probably wait for some signs
of separating, and be down upon a
single one not long after she cleared
the Leychelles islands, where a lonely
enough stretch of the Indian Ocean
spreads in. The more I entered
upon the thought of it, the more
unsufferable it got; especially one
day in the mouth of the Mozambique,
when it fell a dead calm with a heavy
up-and-down swell, fit to roll the
sticks out of her; the high blue land
of Madagascar being in sight, sometimes
to starboard, sometimes to port,
then astern, and the clear horizon
lying away north-west, dark with a
breeze from round the coast. As the
hot sun blazed out above us, and the
blue water came plunge up over the
rail, blazing and flashing, first one
side dipped, then the other, I could
fancy the passengers on the Indiaman's
poop in a light breeze with a
suspicious lateen-rigged sail creeping
up on her quarter. I thought I saw
Violet Hyde's eyes sparkle against
the glare of light, and her lips parting
to speak&mdash;till I actually stamped on
the deck, my fists clenched, and I
made three strides to the very taffrail
of the schooner. All at once I met
my second mate's eye coolly fixed on
me, which brought me to my senses
in a moment, the more so as there
was something about this man Jones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
I couldn't make out, and I had made
up my mind to keep a sharp eye on
him; though the fact was, it annoyed
me most to feel him seeing into <em>me</em>,
as it were, without troubling himself.
"We shall have the breeze before long,
sir, round Cape Mary yonder," said
he, stepping forward. "So I expect,
myself, Mr Jones," said I, "though
you evidently know the coast better
than I do." With that I gave him a
careless side-look, but to all appearance
there was nothing particular in
his, as he told me he had seen it two
or three times before.</p>

<p>With the evening we were once
more running sharp on a wind up
channel; and when she did get her
own way in a good breeze, the
schooner's qualities came out. 'Twas a
perfect luxury to look over the side
and see the bubbles pass, her sharp
bows sliding through it like a knife,
she eating into the wind all the time
in a way none but a fore-and-aft
clipper could hope to do, with a
glassy blue ripple sent back from her
weather-bow as far as the forechains:
then to wake of a morning
and feel her bounding under you with
a roll up to windward, while the
water gushed through and through
below the keel, and ran yearning and
toppling away back along the outer
timbers into her boiling wake, working
with the moving rudder. And
our man-o'-warsmen were quite delighted
with the Young Hebe, as they
still called her. Snelling was in his
element while we were having the
new spars sent up aloft&mdash;a set of
longer sticks than before&mdash;till she
had twice the air, as well as a knowing
rake aft. Next thing was to get the
long-brass nine-pounder amidships
from under the boat, where the
Frenchmen had kept it, besides which
we found another in her hold; so
that, added to six small carronades
already on deck, we made a pretty
show. Meanwhile, for my own part,
I kept cracking on with every stitch
of canvass that could be clapped upon
the spars, including studding-sails.
Jones himself didn't know better than
I did by this time how to handle the
craft, schooner though she was, in the
way of making her use what weather
we had to the best purpose. Variable
as it proved, too, I was aware the
Indiamen would have pretty much
the same now as we had; so that, on
going aloft with the glass, as I did
every watch in the day, I soon began
each time expecting one or other of
them to heave in sight.</p>

<p>As for the five hands from Cape
Town, they seemed to have fallen
in cheerfully enough with our own;
and as soon as the fine weather came,
the gang of Lascars were set to duty
like the rest. Snelling would have
them even trained to work the guns;
although, if it blew at all hard, not
one could be got to go aloft except
their old <em>serang</em>, and the <em>tindal</em>, his
mate. What surprised me most was
the harbour officer himself at last
asking, as Mr Snelling told me, to be
put in a watch; but as the midshipman
said there was no doubt Webb
had made a voyage or two before,
somewhere or other, I agreed to it at
once. "I'm not sure, sir," added the
midshipman, with one of his doubtful
double looks, "but the gentleman may
have seen blue-water the first time at
Government expense, and not in the
service either&mdash;he don't look fore
and aft enough, Mr Collins, harbour
officer though he be; but never mind,
sir, I'll see after him!"&mdash;"Pooh,"
said I, laughing; "if he does turn to,
Mr Snelling, it shan't be in the watch
<em>you</em> have to do with! Hand him over
to Mr Jones." By this time I had
changed the mid into my own watch,
and given Jones charge of the other&mdash;so
to him the harbour officer went.</p>

<p>The main character aboard of us,
to me at any rate, was this Jones
himself. The fact was, at first I had
my doubts of him altogether, partly
owing to the queer way we got hold
of him, partly on account of his
getting the upper hand so much
through chance, in the tremendous
weather we had at the outset, till I
wasn't sure but it might come into the
fellow's head of itself, to be upon
some drift or other that might cost
me trouble, as things stood. However,
I no sooner felt where I was,
and got the craft under my own spoke,
than I came to set him down for nothing
but one of those strange hands
you fall in with at sea sometimes, always
sailing with a "purser's name,"
a regular wonder of a shipmate, and
serving to quote every voyage after,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
by way of a clincher on all hard
points, not to say an oracle one can't
get beyond, and can't flow sky-high
enough. To tell the truth, though,
Jones was as thorough a seaman as
ever I met with&mdash;never at a loss,
never wanting on any hand; whether
it was the little niceties we stood in
need of for setting the schooner's rigging
all right again, which none but a
blue-water long-voyage sailor can
touch, or, what comes to be still better
in tropical latitudes, a cool head and
a quick hold, with full experience for
all sorts of weather, 'twas much the
same to him. He was all over like
iron, too, never seeming to stand in
need of sleep, and seeing like a hawk.
At any hour I came on deck in his
watch, there was Jones, all awake
and ready, till hearing him walk the
planks over my head of a fine night
made me at times keep my eyes open,
listening to it and the wash of the
water together. I fancied there was
something restless in it, like the sea,
with now and then an uneven sort of
a start; and at last it would come to
full stop, that gave me the notion of
how he was standing quiet in the
same spot; whether he was looking
aloft, or thinking, or leaning over the
side, or what he was going to do,
troubled me wonderfully. The only
want in his seamanship I noticed, he
evidently wasn't used to handle a
large ship; but craft of some kind I
was pretty sure he had commanded
in the course of his life. As for taking
observations, he could do it better
than I could then; while the knowledge
he had on different heads, that
came out by chance, made you think
more of a Cambridge graduate than a
common sailor, such as he had shipped
for with us. The strangest part of
all about him, though, was what I
couldn't well name, not to this day:
'twas more grained in his manner,
and the ring of his voice at particular
moments, as well as his walk,
though these were the smart seaman's
no less; but one couldn't help thinking
of a man that had known the
world ashore some time or other, in
a different enough station from now&mdash;ay,
and in a way to bring out softer
lines in his face than reefing topsails
or seeing the main-tack ridden down
would do. The nearest I could come
to calling it, far apart as the two men
stood, was to fancy he reminded me of
Lord Frederick Bury himself; especially
when he looked all of a sudden
to the horizon in that wide, vacant
kind of fashion, as if he expected it
farther off than it was: only Jones's
face was twice the age, like a man's
that had had double the passions in it
at the outset, and given them full
swing since then; with a sleeping
devil in his eye yet, besides, as I
thought, which only wanted somewhat
to rouse it. Only for that, I had a
sort of leaning to Jones myself; but,
as it was, I caught myself wishing,
over and over, for something to make
us fall regularly foul of each other,
and get rid of this confounded doubtful
state. One hitch of a word to
take hold of, and, by Jove! I felt all
the blood in my body would boil out
in me to find how we stood, and show
it; but nothing of the kind did Jones
let pass&mdash;and as close as the sea itself
he was in regard to his past life. As
for the men from the frigate, at least,
they seemingly looked on him with no
great fondness, and a good deal of respect,
in spite of themselves, for his
seamanship; whereas, if he had been
left in the forepeak in place of the
cabin, I've no doubt in a short time
it would have been no man but Jones.
You light now and then upon a man
afloat, indeed, that his shipmates hold
off from, as healthy dogs do from a
mad one; and you saw they had
some sort of an inkling of the gloomy
close nature Jones had in him, by the
way they obeyed his orders. Webb's
three Cape Dutchmen seemed to have
a notion he was some being with mysterious
powers, while the Lascars ran
crouching at his very word&mdash;some of
them being, as I found, Malays, and
the rest Mussulmen from Chittagong;
but Jones could send them about in
their own language, Dutchmen and
all&mdash;a part of the matter which did
not tend to keep me less careful over
him. Still I observed, since his coming
aboard, that Jones never once
touched liquor, which had plainly
enough been his ruin ashore; whether
on account of meaning to pull up once
for all and mend, or only to have a
wilder bout at next port, or else to
keep himself steady for aught that
might turn up, I couldn't settle in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
own mind. Though deucedly doubtful
of its being the first, the very idea
of it made one feel for the man; and,
in case of his doing well, I had no
small hopes of something in the upshot
to save a real sailor like him from
going to the devil altogether, as he
seemed doing.</p>

<p>Now, after our getting clear of the
rough Cape weather, and the dead-lights
being taken out of the stern-windows,
I had given a look, for the
first time, into the schooner's after-cabins,
which were pretty much as the
people she belonged to before had left
them, except for the rough work the
gale had played. There were two of
them, one opening into the other; and
I must say it was a melancholy sight
to meet the bright sunlight streaming
into them from off the water astern,
with all the little matters either just
as if the owners were still inside, or
else tumbled about at sixes and sevens.
One drawer, in particular, had come
out of a table, scattering what was in
it on the deck: there was a half open
letter in a woman's hand, all French,
and showing a lock of hair, with a
broken diamond cross of the French
Legion of Honour, besides a sort of
paper-book full of writing, and two
printed ones bound in morocco. I
picked up the letter and the cross,
put them in again, and shoved the
drawer back to its place, though I
brought the books away with me to
have a glance over. What struck me
most, though, was a plaster figure of
the French emperor himself, standing
fastened on a shelf, with one hand in
the breast of his great coat, and looking
calmly out of the white sightless
eyes; while right opposite hung a
sort of curtain which you'd have
thought they were fixed upon. When
I hauled it aside, I started&mdash;there, on
a shelf to match the other, was a
beautiful smiling child's head to the
shoulders, of pure white marble, as
if it leant off the bulkhead like a cherub
out of the clouds. Spite of all, however,
the touch of likeness it had to
the head I got such a glimpse of at
Longwood, even when the hot sunlight
showed it in my spy-glass so pale
and terrible, was sufficient to tell me
what <em>this</em> was,&mdash;Napoleon's own little
son, in fact, who was made king of
Rome, as I remembered hearing at
the time. The thought of the
schooner's strange French captain,
and his desperate scheme, came back
on me so strong, joined to what I
saw he had an eye to in fitting out his
cabins, that, for my own part, I
hadn't the heart to use them myself,
and at first sight ordered the dead-lights
to be shipped again, and the
door locked.</p>

<p>'Twas a good many days after this,
of course, and we had made a pretty
fast run up the Mozambique, in spite
of the sharp navigation required,
sighting nothing larger than the native
and Arab craft to be seen thereabouts;
we were beginning to clear out from
amongst the clusters of islands and
shoals at the channel head, when two
large sail were made in open water to
nor'-eastward. Next morning by daybreak
we were to windward of the
weathermost,&mdash;a fine large Indiaman
she was, crowding a perfect tower of
canvass. Shortly after, however, the
schooner was within hail, slipping
easily down upon her quarter, which
seemed to give them a little uneasiness,
plenty of troops as she seemed
to have on board, and looming like a
frigate. After some showing of keeping
on, and apparently putting faith in
the man-o'-war pennant I hoisted,
she hove into the wind, when we
found she was the Company's ship
Warringford, and the other the something
Castle, I forget which, both for
Calcutta. The next thing, as soon
as they found we were tender to his
Majesty's frigate Hebe, was to ask
after the Seringapatam; on which I
was told she was three or four days
sail ahead with the Mandarin, bound
to China, neither of them having put
in at Johanna Island to refresh. I
was just ready to put our helm up
again and bid good-bye, when the
tiffin gong could be heard sounding on
the Indiaman's quarterdeck, and the
old white-haired captain politely
asked me if I wouldn't come aboard
with one or two of my officers to
lunch. Mr Snelling gave me a wistful
glance&mdash;there were a dozen pretty
faces admiring our schooner out of the
long white awnings: but even if the
notion of bringing up Snelling himself
as my first officer hadn't been
too much for me, not to speak of
either Jones or Webb, why the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
thoughts that everything I saw recalled
to me, made me the more
eager to get in sight of the Seringapatam.
"Thank you, sir," answered
I. "No&mdash;I must be off after the Bombay
ship."&mdash;"Ah," hailed the old
captain, "some of your Admiral's
post-bags, I suppose. Well, keep as
much northing as you can, sir, and I
daresay you'll find her parted company.
She's got a jury fore topmast
up, for one she lost a week ago;
so you can't mistake her for the Mandarin,
with a good glass."&mdash;"Have you
noticed any suspicious craft lately,
sir?" asked I. "Why, to tell you
the truth, lieutenant," sang out he,
looking down off the high bulwarks
at our long nine-pounders and the
knot of Lascars, "none more so
than we thought <em>you</em>, at first, sir!"
The cadets on the poop roared with
laughter, and an old lady with two
daughters seemed to eye Snelling
doubtfully through an opera-glass, as
the reefer ogled both of them at once.
"By the bye," sang out the captain of
the Indiaman to me again, "I fancy
the passengers in that ship must have
got somehow uncomfortable&mdash;one of
our Bengal grandees aboard of her
wanted a berth to Calcutta with us,
'tother day in the Mozambique;
but we're too full already!"&mdash;"Indeed,
sir?" said I; but the schooner's mainboom
was jibbing over, and with two
or three more hails, wishing them a
good voyage, and so on, away we
slipped past their weather-bow. The
Warringford got under weigh at her
leisure, and in an hour or two her
topsails were down to leeward of us.
On I cracked with square and studding-sails
to the quartering breeze,
till the schooner's light hull jumped to
it, and aloft she was all hung out of a
side, like a dairyman's daughter
carrying milk; with the pace she
went at I could almost say to an hour
when we should overhaul the chase.</p>

<p>Still, after two or three days of the
trade-wind, well out in the Indian
Ocean, and not a spot to be seen, we
had got so far up the Line as to make
me sure we had overrun her.
Accordingly the schooner was hauled
sharp on a wind to cruise slowly down
across what must be the Indiaman's
track, judging as we could to a nicety,
with a knowledge of the weather we had
had. For my part I was so certain of
sighting her soon, that I ordered the
after-cabins to be set to rights, seeing
a notion had taken hold of me of
actually offering them to Sir Charles
Hyde for the voyage to Calcutta&mdash;Fancy
the thought! 'Twas too good to
be likely; but Violet herself actually
being in that little after-cabin and
sleeping in it&mdash;the lively schooner
heading away alone for India, and
they and Westwood the sole passengers
aboard&mdash;why, the idea of it was fit to
drive me crazy with impatience.</p>

<p>Well, one fine night, after being on
deck all day, and the whole night
before, almost, I had turned in to my
cot to sleep. From where I lay I could
see the moonshine off the water
through the stern-light in that after-cabin,
by the half-open door. I felt the
schooner going easily through the
water, with a rise and fall from the
heave of the long Line-swell; so close
my eyes I couldn't, especially as the
midshipman could be heard snoring on
the other side like the very deuce. Accordingly
I turned out into the after-cabin,
and got hold of one of the
Frenchman's volumes to read, when,
lo and behold, I found it was neither
more nor less than Greek, all I knew
being the sight of it. Next I commenced
overhauling the bundle of
handwriting, which I took at first for
a French log of the schooner's voyage,
and sat down on the locker to have a
spell at it. So much as I could make
out, in spite of the queer outlandish
turn the letters had, and the quirks of
the unnatural sort of language, it was
curious enough&mdash;a regular story, in
fact, about his own life, the war, and
Buonaparte himself. At another time
I'd have given a good deal to go
through with it at odd hours&mdash;and a
strange affair I found it was some time
afterwards; but meanwhile I had
only seen at the beginning that his
name was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Compte Victor l'Allemand,
Capitaine de la Marine Française</i>,
and made out at the end how
there was some scheme of his beyond
what I knew before, to be carried out
in India,&mdash;when it struck me there
was no one on the quarterdeck above.
I listened for a minute through the
stern-window, and thought I heard
some one speaking over the schooner's
lee-quarter, as she surged along; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
slipping on a jacket and cap, I went
on deck at once.</p>

<p>It was middle watch at the time;
but as soon as I came up I saw all
was quiet&mdash;Webb near the gangway
talking to the old Lascar serang, and
breaking the English wonderfully
betwixt them; while the Lascars of
the watch were sitting like tailors in a
ring on the forecastle planks, each
waiting for his turn of one cocoa-nut
hookah, that kept hubble-bubbling
away gravely under the smoker's nose,
as he took a long suck at it, while the
red cinder in the bowl lighted up his
leathery Hindoo face and mustache
like a firefly in the root of a banian, till
he handed it, without even a wipe, to his
neighbour. These fellows had begun
to get much livelier as we made the
tropics; and this same serang of theirs
had put out his horns once or twice
to Snelling lately, though he drew
them in again the moment he saw me&mdash;a
sulky old knotty-faced, yellow-eyed
devil I thought him at any rate, while
his dish-cloth of a turban, his long
blue gown and red trousers, reminded
you at sea in a gale of a dancing
dervish. The day we spoke the
Indiaman, in fact, I noticed there was
something in the wind for a minute
or two with him and his gang, which
put it in my head at first to offer
them to the captain for a couple of
good English hands; and as I passed
him and Webb this time, the serang
stopped his talk, and sidled off.</p>

<p>However, a beautiful night it was,
as ever eye looked upon even in the
blue Indian Ocean: the heavens
cloudless, the full round moon shining
high off our weather-beam again, the
stars drawn up into her bright light,
as it were, trembling through the films
of it like dew-drops in gossamer of a
summer morning: you saw the sea
meet the sky on every hand, without
a speck on the clear line of horizon,
through the squares of our ratlins and
betwixt the schooner's two long fore-and-aft
booms. A pretty strongish
breeze we had, too, blowing from east
to west with a sweep through the
emptiness aloft, and a wrinkling ripple
over the long gentle swells, as deep in
the hue as if fresh dye came from the
bottom, and crisping into a small
sparkle of foam wherever they caught
it full. Something pleasant, one
couldn't say what, was in the air; and
every sheet being hauled taut to hold
wind, the slant gush of it before her
beam drove her slipping ahead toward
the quarter it came from, with a dip
down and a saucy lift of her jibs
again, as if she were half balanced
amidships, but little noise about it.
I took a squint aloft and an overhaul
all round, and nothing was to be seen.
The size of the sky through the moonlight
looked awful, as it were, and the
strength of the breeze seemed to send
a heavenly blue deep into the western
quarter, till you saw a star in it. The
night was so lovely, in fact, it somehow
made one think of one's mother,
and old times, when you used to say
your prayers. Still I couldn't see the
mate of the watch on the weather quarterdeck,
which surprised the more in
Jones's case, since he was always ready
for me when I came up; and, to tell
the truth, I shouldn't have been sorry
to catch him napping for once, only to
show he was like men in common. I
walked aft by the weather side of the
large mainsail, accordingly, till I saw
him leaning with his head over the lee-bulwark,
and heard him again, as I
thought, apparently speaking to some
one down the schooner's side; upon
which I stepped across. Jones's back
was to me as I looked over too; but
owing to what he was busy with, I
suppose, and the wash of the water,
which was louder there than inboard,
while you heard the plash from her
bows every time she forged, he evidently
didn't hear me. You may
fancy my wonder to find he was reading
loud out to himself from the other
of the Frenchman's volumes, which I
had no doubt left in the dining-cabin&mdash;the
book open in both hands&mdash;he giving
it forth in long staves, with a break
between&mdash;and regular Greek it was,
too: you'd have thought he timed
them to the plash alongside; and I
must say, as every string of long-tailed
words flowed together like one,
in Jones's deep voice, and the swell
rose once or twice with its foam-bells
near his very hands, I almost fancied
I made a meaning of them&mdash;each like
a wave, as it were, sweeping to a
crest, and breaking. The gusto the
man showed in it you can't conceive;
and, what was more, I had no doubt
he understood the sense of it, for all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
a sudden, after twenty staves or so of
the kind, he stopped.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> "There!"
said he, "there, old Homer&mdash;women,
wine, and adventure&mdash;what could the
devil ask more, blind old prater, with
a sound in you like the sea? Ay,
wash, wash, wash away, lying old
blue-water, you cant wash <em>it</em> out&mdash;and
wine&mdash;no, not the strongest rum in
Cape Town&mdash;can wash <em>you</em> out!"
With that Jones laid his head on his
arms, with the book still in one hand,
muttering to himself, and I listened in
spite of me. "Still it rouses the old
times in me!" said he. "Here comes
this book across me, too. Ay, ay, and
the Rector fancied, sitting teaching me
Greek out of old wild Homer all week
day&mdash;and&mdash;and his girl slipping out
and in&mdash;'twould do to don the cassock of
a Sunday and preach out of the pulpit
against the world, the devil, and the
flesh&mdash;then warn me against the sea&mdash;ha!"
The laugh that came from him
at that moment was more like a dog
than a human being; but on he went
muttering "Women, wine, and adventure,
said ye, old Greek, and a goddess
too; still he <em>was</em> a good old man the
Rector&mdash;no guile nor evil in him, with
his books in the cases yonder, and the
church-spire seen through the window
over the garden, and his wife with&mdash;ah,
the less of that. 'Twas in me,
though, and all the blood&mdash;and in <i>her</i>
dark eyes, too, Mary, though she
was! Damnation!" he broke out
again, after a bit, as if he'd been
arguing it with something under the
side, "I didn't take her the first time
I came home&mdash;nor the second&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;ay,
I came <em>back</em>! Oh that parting-stile,
in sight of the sea&mdash;and that
packet-ship&mdash;but oh God! that night,
that night with the schooner forging
ahead through the blue&mdash;blue&mdash;" And
he stopped with a groan that shook
him as he leant over. "Hellish, hellish
by God!" he said, suddenly
standing upright and looking straight
aloft, with his bare head and face to
the wide empty sky, and the moonlight
tipping the hair on his forehead,
from over the high shadow on the lee-side
of the mainsail, where it glistened
along the gaff. "She was pure to the
last!" I heard him say, though I had
walked to the other side of the boom;
"ay, though I rot to perdition for it!&mdash;Down,
old fiend!" as he lifted his
one hand with the book, and drove it
alongside, seemingly watching it settle
away astern.</p>

<p>Now I had heard nothing from
Jones that I couldn't have fancied
before, and there was even a humour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to my mind in the notion of clapping
it all on old Homer, if Homer it was,
and heaving him overboard with such
a confoundedly complimentary burial-service.
But some of the words that
dropped from him shot through one's
veins like icicles: and now there was
something fearful in the sight of him
standing straight again, with a look
right into the heavens, as if he'd have
searched them up and up&mdash;in that
lovely night too, spread far and wide&mdash;the
very rays of the moonlight
sparkled down the weather side of the
sail I was on, trembling on the leech-ropes
and brails as they swayed, and
into the hollows they made in the belly
of the taut canvass: the long shining
spot of it wavered and settled on the
same two planks of the quarterdeck,
beyond the shadow of the bulwark
from the moon's eye, fast as the
schooner moved through the water,
and it was like a hand laid upon her,
with the air and wind stretching
between. Of a sudden I saw Jones
wheel slowly round where he stood,
like a man turned about by main
strength, with his eyes fixed aloft,
and his one arm raising from the shoulder
till his forefinger pointed to something,
as I thought, about the fore-to'gallant
sail. His face was like
ashes, his eye glaring, and I sprang
across to him under the main-boom.
"See!" said he, never turning his
head, and the words hissed betwixt
his teeth, "look at that!"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, <em>what</em>, Mr
Jones?" said I. "<em>Her&mdash;her</em>," was
his answer, "coming against the wind&mdash;dead
fore-and-aft in the shade of
the sails!" On the lee-sides of them
the high boom-sails made a sort of a
thin shadow against the moonshine off
the other beam, which came glimpsing
through between them out of a world
of air to the south-east, with a double
of it flickering alongside on the water
as it heaved past to leeward; and
whether it was fancy, or whether it
was but the reflection aloft from below,
I thought, as I followed Jones's finger,
I saw something like the shape of a
woman's dress floating close in with
the bonnet of the foretopmast-staysail,
from the dusk it made to the
breast of the fore-topsail, and even
across the gush of white light under
the yard&mdash;long and straight, as it were,
like a thing lifted dripping out of
water, and going, as he said, right
against the schooner's course. "Now
in the foresail!" whispered Jones, his
eye moving as on a pivot, and a thrill
ran through me at the notion, for I
made out one single moment what I
thought a face against the sky at the
gaff-end, white as death, shooting aft
toward the mainsail,&mdash;though next
instant I saw it was but a block
silvered by the moon as the schooner
lifted. "Now the mainsail!" said he
huskily, "and now&mdash;now, by the
heavens&mdash;rising&mdash;rising to the gaff-topsail&mdash;away!
Oh Christ! <em>Mary!</em>"</p>

<p>He was leaning aft toward the
width of the sky, with both hands
clutched together before him, shuddering
all over. For the first minute my
own blood crept, I must say; but
directly after I touched him on the
shoulder. "This is strange, Mr
Jones," said I, "what's the matter?"
"Once in the Bermudas!" said he,
still wildly, "once in the Pacific&mdash;and
now! Does the sea give up its dead,
though, think ye?"&mdash;"You've a
strong fancy, Mr Jones, that's all," I
said, sternly. "Fancy!" said he,
though beginning to get the better of
himself; "did ye ever fancy a face
looking down&mdash;down at you in the
utterest scorn&mdash;down sideways off the
shoulder of the garment, as it sticks
wet into every outline like life? All
the time gliding on the other way, too,
and the eyes like two stars a thousand
miles away beyond, as kind as angels'&mdash;neither
wind nor sea can stop it,
till suddenly it rises to the very cope
of heaven&mdash;still looking scornfully
down at you!&mdash;No, sir, fancy it <em>you</em>
couldn't!" The glance he gave me
was somehow or other such as I
couldn't altogether stomach from the
fellow, and he was turning to the side
when I said quietly, "No, nor Homer
either, I daresay!" Jones started
and made a step towards me. "You
heard me a little ago!" rapped out he,
eyeing me. "Yes," I said; "by Jove!
who could help being curious to hear
a sailor spout Greek as you were
doing, Mr Jones?"</p>

<p>"The fact is, Mr Collins," answered
he, changing his tone, "I was well
brought up&mdash;the more shame to me
for bringing myself to what you saw
me. I had a sister drowned, too, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
her passage to America one voyage,
when I was mate of the ship myself.
No wonder it keeps my nerves shaking
sometimes, when I've had too long
about shore."&mdash;"Well, well, Jones,"
said I, rather softening, "you've
proved yourself a first-rate seaman,
and I've got nothing to complain of&mdash;but
I tell You fairly I had my doubts
of you! So you'll remember you're
under the Articles of War aboard here,
sir," added I, "which as long as I
have this schooner under hand, I'll be
hanged if I don't carry out!" All at
once the thought struck me a little
inconveniently, of my carrying off
Webb and his people, and I fancied
Jones's quick eye wandered to the
Lascars forward. "I know it, sir,"
said he, looking me steadily in the
face; "and what's more, Mr Collins,
at any rate I couldn't forget you
picked me out, confounded low as I
looked, to come aft here! 'Tis not
every captain afloat that has such a
good eye for a seaman, as <em>I</em> know!"
"Oh well, no more about it," I said,
walking forward on the weather side,
and leaving him on the lee one as distinctly
as Lord Frederick Bury could
have done to myself in the frigate.
Jones no doubt thought I didn't notice
the slight wrinkle that gathered round
his lee-eye when he gave me this touch
of butter at the end; but I put it down
for nothing more, gammon though it
was.</p>

<p>It was near the end of the watch,
the moon beginning to set, while it
still wanted three hours of daybreak
in those latitudes, when the look-out
on the top-gallant-yard, who was
stationed there in man-o'-war cruising
fashion, reported a sail to windward.
Just then the midshipman came on
deck to his watch, wonderfully early
for him indeed: and on my remarking
it was probably the Indiaman at
last, Jones himself went aloft with
the night-glass to make her out.
"Mr Snelling," said I, "see the
hands on deck ready for going about."
Next minute I saw him rousing up
the rest of the Lascars, who slept
watch and watch on the forecastle.
Only five or six of the Hebe's men
were up; and all of them, save the
man at the wheel, ran aloft to rig out
stunsail-booms to windward, as soon
as the schooner was fairly on the
starboard tack, standing to nor'-eastward.
Suddenly I saw a scuffle
between the midshipman, and the
tindal,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a stout dark-faced young
Bengalee, with a jaunty scull-cap and
frock, whom Snelling had probably
helped along with a touch of a rope's
end; and in a moment two or three
more of them were upon him; while the
reefer drew his dirk, and sung out to
me, scarce before I was with him, the
Lascars rolling into the lee-scuppers at
two kicks of my foot. Webb and
three of the men from Cape Town
were hoisting a stunsail at the time,
the smart man-o'-war'smen aloft singing
out to them to bear a hand. What
with the noise of the sail flapping, and
its being betwixt my own men and
the deck, they could know nothing of
the matter; and the Lascars let go the
halliards in a body, making a rush at
Snelling and myself with everything
they could pick up in the shape of a
spar.</p>

<p>This would have been nothing, as
in two or three minutes more the men
would have been down, and the cocoa-faced
rascals dodged every way from
the handspike I got hold of; but I
just caught a glimpse on one side of
the sly old serang shoving on the fire-scuttle
to keep down the watch below;
and on the other, of Webb looking
round him, evidently to see how
matters stood. Two Dutchmen seized
the first sailor that came down the
rigging, by the legs, and I saw the
affair must be finished at once, it had
so much the look of a regular plot on
Webb's part, if Jones wasn't concerned
in it too. I made one spring
upon my Cape Town gentleman, and
took him by the throat with one
hand, while I hit the biggest Dutchman
full behind the ear, felling him
to the deck; on which the man-o'-war's
man grappled his watchmate,
and Webb was struggling with me
sufficiently to keep both my hands
full, when I had a pleasant inkling of
a Malay Lascar slipping toward my
back with a bare kreese in his fist.
I just looked over my shoulder at his
black eyes twinkling devilishly before
he sprang, when some one came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
sliding fair down from the fore-top-mast-head
by a backstay, and pitched
in a twinkling on top of his head&mdash;a
thing enough to break the neck of a
monument. Directly after, I saw
Jones himself hitting right and left
with his night-glass, from the moonlight
to the shadow of the foresail,
while Snelling tumbled over a Lascar
at every slap, standing up in boxer
style. By the time the rest of the
men came down all was settled&mdash;the
Dutchmen sulking against the bulwarks,
and Webb gasping after I let
him go. "Boatswain," said I to one
of the sailors, "clap that man in irons
below. Mr Snelling, see the watch
called, sir." "I 'ad the law with
me," said Webb gloomily. "You
plotted it then, Mr Webb?" I said.
"Didn't you carry us off illegally?"
said he. "I only meant to recover the
vessel&mdash;upon my honour, nothing
more, sir; and if you're 'ard with me,
you'll have to answer for it, I assure
you!" Here he looked round to Jones
in a strange way, as I fancied for a
moment; but Jones turned on his heel
with a sneer. "Why, Mr Webb,"
answered I, "you lost that tack by
offering yourself in a watch, which
makes the thing neither more nor less
than mutiny&mdash;so take him below, do ye
hear, bo'sun!" And down he went.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr Jones," said I, as soon
as all hands were on deck, "you'll be
so good as have half of these Lascars
seized to the rigging here, one after
the other, and see a good dozen given
to each of their backs; then these
two Dutchmen, each three dozen&mdash;then
pipe down the watch, sir."
Jones glanced at me, then at the
fellows, then at me again. I thought
he hung aback for an instant; but do
it I was determined he should, for a
reason I had; and I gave him back
the look steady as stone. "Ay, ay,
sir," said he at last, touching his hat.
I walked aft to the capstan, and stood
there till every mother's son of them
had got his share, the Lascars wriggling
and howling on the deck after
it, and the Dutchmen twisting their
backs as they walked off. 'Twas the
first time I did that part of duty in
command; and I felt, in the circumstances,
I was in for carrying it out
with a taut hand.</p>

<p>By this time the moon was setting,
and in the dusk we lost sight of the
sail to windward; but as we were
heading well up to weather upon her,
and going at least ten knots, I turned
in below for a little, leaving the midshipman.
Accordingly, it wasn't very
long before Snelling called me in broad
daylight. "She's a large ship, Mr
Collins," said he, "standing under all
sail on a wind. I hope to goodness, sir,
it's that confounded Indiaman at last!"
I hurried on deck, took the glass aloft,
and soon made out the jury-foretop-mast
shorter than the main, as the
old captain mentioned. Accordingly
it was with somewhat of a flutter in
me I came down again, watching the
schooner's trim below and aloft, to
see if I couldn't take an hour or so off
the time betwixt that and once
more setting eyes on the Judge's
daughter.</p>

<h2>THE JEW BILL.</h2>


<p>The period at which this obnoxious
measure has been brought forward,
limits our present remarks to a
few paragraphs. But we have so
long fought for the Constitution, that
We cannot suffer the month to pass
without reprobating an intrigue,
which we cannot but regard as most
dangerous to the Empire. We are no
bigots,&mdash;we demand no surrender of
the rights of opinion,&mdash;we force no man
to our altars,&mdash;we forbid no man's
access to his own; but to avert public
evil is a duty of every subject,&mdash;to strip
hypocrisy is clearly an act of justice,&mdash;and
to protect religion is only an act
of supreme necessity. We solemnly
believe, that to bring the Jew into
the Parliament of England, would be
at once injury to the Constitution, a
peril to public principle, and an insult
to Christianity.</p>

<p>The attempt was made last year,
and was defeated. It is now to be
renewed, without the slightest additional
ground, and the battle will
have to be fought over again. Must
we not ask, is this experiment to
be again made on public patience?
Is it meant to tell the people of England,
that what common sense rejects,
is to be forced on general weariness;
that what manly principle repels, is to
be gained by vulgar perseverance; and
that which public judgement denounces,
is to be made law by the united effect
of disgust and disdain producing indifference?
We trust that the common
sense of England will speak such a language
to the Legislature, as to extinguish
the <em>prestige</em> that obstinacy in the
wrong is more effective than honesty
in the right; that to be sickened of a
struggle, is a legitimate reason for
abandoning the contest; and that a
great nation can be yawned out of the
greatest interests in the world.</p>

<p>The first question of all is, Can this
admission of the Jew into a Christian
legislature be compatible with the
character of a Christian constitution?
If we live in bad times, with the evidence
of bad practices in important
positions, and with a powerful propensity
among influential classes to
sacrifice everything to the moment,
this consciousness should only be a
stronger claim on the vigilance of
honest men. However strangely it
may sound in some ears, England is
still a Christian country: however
some may doubt, the country still
demands a Christian legislature; and,
notwithstanding all opinions on the
subject, we believe that to worship
God and Mammon is still as impossible
as it was pronounced to be eighteen
hundred years ago. We believe that it
is only by national virtue that nations
can retain the divine protection; that
zeal for the divine honour is the supreme
source of virtue; and that to
sacrifice the honour of God to any
earthly purpose, is only to bring divine
desertion on a people. Must we not
ask, is there any national demand,
national necessity, or religious principle,
connected with giving legislative
power, at this time, to the Jew?</p>

<p>Where is the national demand? If
the Jew, in some instances, is rich,
is mere money to be the qualification
for giving legislative power? In the
simplest point of view, must we not
demand ability, personal honour, a
personal interest in the country, and
a personal evidence that the trustee
will never betray or abandon his
trust? But what is the Jew? He has
<em>no</em> country. By being equally a member
of all countries, he is equally an
alien in all; beyond the casual connexion
of trade, he has no connexion
with any kingdom of earth: his only
country is his counting-house,&mdash;his
only city is the Exchange. His world
consists in his traffic; and if any
calamity should fall on one of those
kingdoms where he keeps his counting-house,
he transfers himself, like a Bill
of Exchange, to the next; and in
whatever land is equally at home. The
Jew gives no pledge to any country;
he is no possessor of land, no leader of
science, no professor of the liberal pursuits,
no manufacturer, no merchant,
no sailor, no soldier; as if some irresistible
destination prohibited him from
ever finally settling in any land, his
property is always ready to take
wing. Must we not ask, Is this fugitive
the man who has a right to share<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the privileges of the Englishman,
bound, as we are, to the soil by nature,
and bound to its defence and prosperity
by the indissoluble obligation
of nature?</p>

<p>In a political point of view, what
security could we have for confiding
in the Jew,&mdash;for intrusting our finances,
our liberties, our councils, the
guardianship of our country, to the
Jew? The especial and perpetual
object of his existence is money. Now,
while every man knows that money is
the great corrupter of the human
mind, that, except in minds fully fortified
by principle, it overwhelms all
other objects, and that, in all the
convulsions of the greatest war of
Europe&mdash;the war of the French
Revolution&mdash;the secrets of every Continental
cabinet were at the mercy of
the purse; do we desire to see this
supremacy extended? Do we desire
to see the principles of fraud and falsehood
made a regular material in the
market of public transactions, and
lucre exalted into the sole object of
existence?</p>

<p>As to the practical effect of bringing
the tribe of the money-dealer into
Parliament, would any man, in the
exercise of his experience, wish to see
the finances of England in the hands of
any Jew in existence? And let no
man pretend that this conception is
imaginary. Place a Jew in Parliament,
giving him the power of making
a party; give him the opportunity of
working on the impulses, habits, or
necessities of men; and in twelve
months you may see him anything he
desires,&mdash;even Chancellor of the Exchequer.
But he is a man of honour;
he will not sell the secrets of Council;
he will not copy a despatch for the
benefit of his partners; he will not
raise or sink the stocks, though every
movement may add a million to the
coffers of his partnership. We hope
not; but can we run the risk? But
the fact is, that he is a man not to be
judged of by the feelings of any other
in the world; he differs from all other
men. What is patriotism to the Jew?
He knows nothing of it. Who ever
heard of the Jew taking any part in
those noble struggles which have saved
the honour or secured the rights of
any nation on earth? His business is
gain, and it is the only business that
he ever follows; from the man with
ten firms and five hundred clerks, with
a counting-house in every village from
the Rhine to the Neva, down to the
seller of old clothes, and the pedlar in
dilapidated slippers, who ever heard
of a Jew thinking of anything but to
make money?</p>

<p>But the view which must supersede
all others, is the aspect of the measure
as it relates to religion. Great Britain
is certainly, on the whole, a religious
country: it perhaps contains
more true religion than all the earth
besides; but its fault is, that, though
reverent in the church, it does not
sufficiently carry its reverence into the
course of common life. If this were
done, there would be no difficulties in
public opinion. It is in no superstition
that we say, the only question
to be asked on any doubtful course of
action is, "Will it please God? Is it
for the honour of God?" This is what
the Scripture calls "walking with
God," and describes as the essential
character of virtue. But the majority
of mankind add to those questions,
Will it benefit myself? The statesman
asks, Shall I lose power by it?&mdash;the
merchant, Shall I lose profit?&mdash;the
tradesman, Shall I lose custom? And
this question is the master-key to the
diversities of opinion on points which,
to the unbiassed mind, are as clear as
the sun.</p>

<p>Let us put the matter in a more
every-day point of view. Let us suppose
the question asked, Would you
take for your friend a man who denied
your God, who scoffed at your religion,
and who declared yourself a dupe or a
deceiver? Yet all this the Jew does
openly by the profession of his own
creed. Can you conceive it for the
honour of your Redeemer, to give this
man your confidence in the highest
form in which it can be given by a
subject? Or can you bring yourself to
believe that you are doing your duty
to Christ in declaring by your conduct,
that to be hostile to Him makes
no imaginable difference in your estimate
of the character of any man?</p>

<p>On those points it is wholly impossible
that there can be any doubt
whatever. The enemy of Christ cannot,
without a crime, be favoured, still
less patronised and promoted, by the
friend of Christ. Now, this feeling is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
neither prejudice nor persecution: it
merely takes the words of the Jew
himself; and it would not force him,
by the slightest personal injury, to
change the slightest of his opinions.
It is merely the conduct which all
who were unbiassed by gain, or unperverted
by personal objects, would
follow in any common act of life. To
give power to the Jew, from the motives
of pelf, or party, or through
indifference, is criminal; and it is
against this crime that we protest,
and that we desire to guard our fellow
Christian.</p>

<p>We must now rapidly pass through
the leading points of the question.
The Jew is a "condemned man."
More than three thousand years ago,
Moses, in pronouncing the future history
of the people, declared that a
teacher should finally be sent to their
nation, like himself, a man; and
mingling as such among men, to give
them a law, not in clouds and thunders
as at Sinai, nor written in tables of
stone, nor fixed in stern ordinances, but
written in the heart, and acting by the
understanding: and that, if they rejected
him, they should be made
nationally to answer the national
crime to the Almighty. Him they
rejected, and the rejection has been
answered by national ruin. The prophecy
is before the eye of the world;
the fulfilment is also before the eye
of the world.</p>

<p>The Jew is an undone being, if there
be truth in the words of inspiration.
"He that believeth in the Son hath
everlasting life; and he that believeth
not the Son, <em>shall not see life</em>; but the
<em>wrath of God</em> abideth on him." (John
iii. 35, 36.) What right have we to
dispense with such words? The
declaration is unequivocal; and if
there be a compassionate allowance
for the barbarian, who has no
Bible and whom the gospel has
never reached, what allowance can
there be for the Jew, possessing the
Bible and living in the sound of the
gospel? But this language is not
alone. We have the declaration of
ruin constantly expressed or implied,
"Who is a liar, but he that <em>denieth
that Jesus is the Christ</em>? Whosoever
<em>denieth the Son</em>, the same <em>hath not the
Father</em>." (1 John ii. 22)</p>

<p>Are those deniers the men whom
the Christian is to take into the
very centre of his political favouritism?
Are the brands of Scripture on
the national forehead to be scorned by
a people professing obedience to the
Divine will? Can human conception
supply a stronger proof of the reality
of those brands than the condition of
the Jews ever since their first fulfilment,
in the fall of Jerusalem&mdash;the
terrible reply to their own anathema,
"His blood be on us, and on our
children."</p>

<p>What is the state of the Jew himself
with respect to sacred things?
Nothing but ignorance can speak of
the <em>religion</em> of the Jew. So far as
belongs to worship, he has <em>none</em>.
Sacrifice, the solemnisation of the
three great festivals, the whole ceremonial
of the temple, were <em>essential</em> to
Judaism. The Jew cannot perform
a single public ceremonial of his religion.
Sacrifice was supremely essential
for nearly the atonement of every
fault of man; but it could be offered
only in the Temple. The Temple is
gone. What now becomes of his
atonement?</p>

<p>A weak attempt is made to answer
this tremendous question, by referring
to the condition of the Jews in Babylon.
But what comparison can exist
between a captivity prophetically
limited to years not exceeding a single
life, passed under the protection of
kings, and under the guardianship of
the most illustrious man of Asia, the
prophet Daniel, cheered by prophecy
and miracle, and certain of return, and
the eighteen hundred years' banishment
of the Jew? What comparison
between the temporary suspension of
the national worship, and the undefined
and hopeless duration which
seems to lie before the Jewish exile;
and which, when it shall close at last,
will extinguish his Judiasm, will show
him his folly only by stripping the
superstition of the Rabbi and the Talmud
from his eyes, and will awake
him at once to the extent of his
error, to the exercise of his understanding,
and to the worship of Christianity?</p>

<p>After considerations of this order,
all others must be almost trivial.
But the common declamation on the
<em>natural right</em> of the Jew to be represented
in Parliament is verbiage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
But the Jew is actually represented,
as much as a multitude of
other interests of superior importance
are represented. Are the fifteen
thousand clergy of the Church of
England (a body worth all the Jews
on the globe) personally represented?
Are the millions of England under
twenty-one represented? One might
thus go through the great industrious
classes of England, and find that, out
of twenty millions, there are not one
million electors. And what claim
have a class&mdash;who come to this country
only to make money, and who
make nothing but money, and who,
if they could make more money anywhere
else on the earth, would go
there to-morrow&mdash;to an equality of
right with the manly, honest, and
attached son of England, every day
of whose life adds something to the
comfort or the credit of the community?</p>

<p>The whole and sole claim of the
Jew is, that some of his party are
rich. How they have made their
riches, or how they spend them, is
beneath us to inquire. But what
are their national evidences, even of
wealth, it might be difficult to discover.
They exhibit no fruits here,
nor anywhere. It has been often
asked, with genuine astonishment,
what signs of national liberality have
ever been given by Jewish wealth in
the world? What contribution does
it make, or has it ever made, to the
arts that decorate life, to the literature
that enlightens it, or to those
bold and commanding services by
which nations are raised or restored?
Where are the picture galleries, or the
great libraries, the great institutions,
erected by the wealth of the Jew?
As to the genius which endows mankind,
for generations to come, with
noble inventions, or leaves its name
behind in a track of glory to posterity,
who ever heard of it among the Jews?
Shopkeepers of London have planted
its vicinity with great establishments,
castles of charity, magnificent monuments
of practical religion, to which
all the works of Jewish bounty are
molehills. The Jews have an hospital
and a few schools,&mdash;and there the
efflux of liberality stops, the stream
stagnates, the river becomes a pond,
and the pond dries away.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, and may be a
punitive consequence, that there is
nothing so fugitive as the wealth of the
Jew. There is perhaps no hereditary
example of Jewish wealth in the
world. In England we have seen
opulent firms, but they have never
had the principle of permanency.
Supposed to be boundlessly wealthy, a
blight came, and every leaf dropt off.
One powerful firm now lords it over
the loan-market of Europe. We have
no desire to anticipate the future; but
what has become of all its predecessors
in this country? or what memorial
have they all left, to make us regret
their vanishing, or remember their
existence?</p>

<p>Of the sudden passion with which
Ministers have snatched the Israelite
to their bosom, we shall leave the explanation
until their day of penitence.
As poverty makes man submit to
strange companionship, political necessity
may make a Whig Cabinet stoop
to the embrace of the Jew. The resource
is desperate, but the exigency
must be equally so. We hail the
omen,&mdash;the grasp at straws shows
nothing but the exhaustion of the
swimmer.</p>

<p>On one point more alone we shall
touch. It is of a graver kind. It has
been the source of a kind of ignorant
consideration for the Jews, that prophecy
speaks of their future restoration.
But, as <em>Jews</em> they will <em>never</em> be
restored. In the last days some
powerful influence of the Holy Spirit
will impel the surviving Jews to solicit
an admission into Christianity.
How many or how few will survive
the predicted universal convulsion of
these days, is not for man to tell; the
terrible, or the splendid, catastrophes
of those times are still hidden; but no
Jew well ever dwell in the presence
of the patriarchs, but as a "new
creature"&mdash;a being cleared from the
prejudices of his exiled fathers, and
by supernatural interposition purified
from the unbelief, to be rescued from
the ruin, of his stiff-necked people.</p>

<p>The measure must be thrown out
by the awakened power of public
opinion. We must not indulge our
indolence in relying on the House of
Lords. They <em>may</em> do their duty, but
<em>we must do ours</em>. The Jew <em>must not</em>
enter the Christian Legislature.</p>

<h2>THE PICTURES OF THE SEASON.</h2>


<p>The taste for pictorial art, if its
progress may be measured by the opportunity
afforded for its gratification,
is decidedly upon the increase in this
country. In London, especially, pictures
of one class or other form, each
successive year, a larger and more
important item in the sum of public
amusements. During the present
season of 1850 there have been open,
at one time, four exhibitions consisting
chiefly of oil paintings, two numerous
collections of water-colour drawings,
and panoramas and dioramas in
unprecedented number and of unusual
excellence. These last, although pertaining
to a lower walk of art, have
strong claims on consideration for
their scenic truthfulness and artistic
skill, and are fairly to be included in
an estimate of the state of public
feeling for the pictorial. The four
first exhibitions alone comprise upwards
of three thousand works of art,
now for the first time submitted to
public inspection. As usual, the exhibition
of the Royal Academy is the
most important and deserving of attention.
Numerically, the Society of
British Artists claims the next place;
but in point of interest it must yield
precedence to the British Institution,
now for some weeks closed, and also
to the exhibition of an association of
artists which has installed itself, upon
a novel principle, and under the title
of the National Institution, in a building
constructed for its accommodation,
and known as the Portland Gallery.
It were for some reasons desirable&mdash;it
certainly would be favourable to the
comparative appreciation of merit&mdash;that,
as at Paris, the whole of the
annual harvest of pictures should be
collected in one edifice, subject, of
course, to such previous examination
by a competent and impartial council,
as should exclude those works unworthy
of exhibition. But such a
system, however pleasant it might be
found by the public, could hardly be
made agreeable to the artists. The
most indulgent censorship, excluding
none but the veriest daubs&mdash;nay, even
the plan of open doors to all comers,
which has lately clothed a portion of
the walls of the Republican Louvre with
canvass spoiled by ignorance and presumption,
would fail to satisfy artists
and their friends. In London, as in
Paris under the old system, it is less
the question of admission than the placing
of the pictures that is the source of
discontent. The excluded conceal
their discomfiture; the misplaced
grumble loudly, and not always without
reason, especially as regards the
Academy exhibition. The fault may
be more in the rooms that contain,
than in the men who place the pictures.
Of course everybody whose
work gets into the Octagon Room feels
aggrieved, although it is evident that,
as long as that ridiculous nook is used
to contain pictures, some unlucky
artists must fill it. The good
places in the other rooms&mdash;limited as
is the extent of these compared to the
large number of pictures annually
exhibited in them&mdash;cannot be very
numerous, although they may be multiplied
by the exercise of judgment,
and by impartial attention to the requirements
of each picture as regards
light and elevation. The best possible
arrangement, however, will fail to
please everybody, and the persons to
whom falls the difficult task of distributing
a thousand or fifteen hundred
pictures over the walls of a suite of
rooms inadequate to their proper
accommodation, must be prepared to
endure some obloquy, and esteem
themselves fortunate if the public acquit
them of flagrant partiality or
negligence. It is not our purpose to
dilate on this oft-mooted and still
vexed question. We have no polemical
intention in the present paper,
in which we shall not have too much
space to note down a few of the
thoughts that suggested themselves to
us during our morning wanderings
amongst the throng of pictures in four
exhibitions.</p>

<p>The great event of the artist's
year, the opening of the Exhibition
of the Royal Academy, is of course
the signal for a Babel of opinions.
The question which on all sides is
heard: What sort of Exhibition is
this? obtains the most conflicting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
replies. People are too apt to trust to
their first impressions, and to indulge
in sweeping censure or excessive encomium.
We have heard this year's exhibition
set down by some as first-rate,
by others as exceedingly poor. Our
own opinion, after careful examination
and consideration, is, that it has rather
less than the average amount of merit.
This we believe to be also the opinion
of the majority of those most competent
to judge. There is certainly an
unusually small number of pictures of
striking excellence; nor is this atoned
for by any marked improvement in
those artists whose works can claim
but a second rank. One circumstance
unfavourable to the interest of the
exhibition is the uncommonly large
number of portraits, the majority of
which are not very admirable either
in subject or execution. The impression,
as one walks through the rooms,
is, that an extraordinary number of
ugly or uninteresting persons have got
themselves painted by careless or indifferent
artists. Of landscapes there
seem to be fewer than usual&mdash;certainly
fewer good ones. Some of the best
of this class of painters have contributed
to other exhibitions. On the
other hand, historical, scriptural, and
dramatic subjects are numerous, but
not in many cases have they been
treated with very great success.
One of the foremost pictures in the
Exhibition&mdash;certainly the one about
which most curiosity has been excited&mdash;is
Edwin Landseer's <cite>Dialogue at
Waterloo</cite>. We are unfeigned admirers
of Mr Landseer's genius, but we do
not think this one of his happiest
efforts. There is much fashion in
these matters; people are very apt
to be led away by a name, and to fall
into ecstasies before a picture simply
because it is by a great painter. We
believe it impossible for Edwin Landseer
to paint anything that shall not
have great merit, but he is certainly
most felicitous when confining himself
to what is strictly speaking his own
style. We do not think him successful
as a portrait painter. His Marchioness
of Douro does less than justice to the
beautiful original. As to the Duke
of Wellington, it is a failure; especially
if, as we are assured, it is intended
to be his portrait as he now
is. We certainly cannot admire
the burly figure and swarthy complexion
of Mr Landseer's Duke, which
gives us the idea of a younger and
more robust man than him it is intended
to represent. We should be disposed
to object to the strained appearance
of the downward-pointing hand;
but the gesture is said to be one habitual
to the original, and of course the
painter was right to preserve character,
even at the cost of grace. The
less prominent portion of the picture
is the most to our taste&mdash;the peasants
and child, the dogs and game, and the
plough horses with their old driver.
We are not quite clear as to what it
all means; some of the objects seeming
rather to have been dragged in
than naturally to have come thither;
the tablecloth spread in the ploughed
field appearing rather out of character,
and the left-hand corner of the picture
having altogether somewhat of a
crowded aspect: but these are trifles
not worth dwelling upon. The painting
is evidently unfinished. The
subject of Mr Landseer's second picture,
a shepherd digging the stragglers
from his flock out of a snow-drift, is
of less interest than that of his larger
work; but, in an artistic point of view,
it claims higher praise. His snow is
admirable, the tender gray tints are
full of light, and distributed with
surpassing skill; and the earnest
laborious face of the delving peasant is
very vigorous and characteristic. Mr
Landseer is so accurate an observer of
brute nature that it is with extreme
caution we venture to criticise his
animals, but we must say that the
wool of his sheep in this painting has
a hard and cork-like look. Upon the
whole it is a question with us, when
we revert to some of this artist's
former productions, whether he is
painting as carefully as he used to do.
Looking at his Waterloo Dialogue, we
say no; but an affirmative starts to
our lips when we examine his last and
smallest picture in this year's Exhibition,
Lady Murchison's dog. With
this the most fastidious would be
troubled to find fault. It is a gem of
admirable finish. If Mr Landseer's
power of drawing, in the grander contours
of his designs, were equal to the
skill he displays in the details, he
would leave nothing to desire.</p>

<p>Mr Maclise has two pictures in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
this exhibition. There is scarcely an
English artist living concerning whom
we are more embarrassed to make
up our minds, than concerning the
painter of <em>The Spirit of Justice</em> and
<em>The Gross of Green Spectacles</em>. His
merits and defects are alike very
great, and unfortunately he delays to
amend the latter&mdash;if indeed it be in
his power so to do. His first-named
and larger picture, whilst it contains
much to admire, leaves a great deal
to be desired. To us it is a vexatious
performance. We cannot look at
it without admitting it to be the work
of no ordinary artist, and we feel the
more annoyed at the mannerism that
detracts from its merit. Mr Maclise
has fertility of invention and power of
design, but there is a deficiency of
true artistical feeling in his execution.
We cannot coincide, besides, with the
notion which he, in common with
many others, seems to entertain, that
fresco painting precludes chiaroscuro.
In <em>The Spirit of Justice</em> there are some
good faces; but there are more that
are unnecessarily ugly, and several
of faulty expression. Justice has a
fine countenance and altogether pleases
us well. The widow's face is hard
and unflesh-like; the accuser, who
drags the murderer before the tribunal,
and displays a bloody dagger as evidence
of guilt, and the free citizen
who unrolls the charter of liberty, are
anything but admirable. The accuser
looks more like an informer than an
avenger. Nothing can be more unfavourable
to the face than the sort
of scrubby, colourless, thinly-sown
stubble with which his chin is provided,
as a contrast, we presume,
with the dark hirsute countenance of
the criminal, who, deducting the
beard, might pass for a portrait of Mr
Macready, of one of whose favourite
attitudes the position of the head and
shoulders particularly reminds us.
With all its defects, however, this is
by far the best of Mr Maclise's two
pieces. <em>The Gross of Spectacles</em> we
consider a failure. It is a gross of
spectacles, and little besides. The first
thing that catches the eye is Moses'
unlucky bargain. There they are, the
twelve dozen, in green cases and with
plated rims. We submit that the first
thing which <em>should</em> attract the eye is
the countenances of the actors in the
scene. Owing to their tameness of
expression, these, which should be
prominent, are almost subordinate to
the inanimate details of the apartment.
Unimportant as it is, we are
inclined to prefer the recess, and the
peep through the window, to any
other part of the picture. There is
an airiness and transparency in that
corner of the canvass, which we in
vain seek elsewhere. The general
effect is very hard. The hair of
Moses and the little boy is as unlike
hair as it well can be: we
remember to have seen something
very like it upon a tea-tray. These
are technical objections. But Mr
Maclise may rely upon it that he
lacks the keen perception of humour
indispensable to the artist who would
illustrate Goldsmith.</p>

<p>Amongst the scriptural and mythological
paintings, those of Mr Patten
and Mr F. R. Pickersgill attract at
least as much notice as they deserve.
Besides portraits, Mr Patten has contributed
three pictures. His <em>Susannah
and the Elders</em> is remarkable
as being the most decidedly indecent
picture exhibited this year. The
subject is not a very pleasing one,
and, to our thinking, has been painted
quite often enough. But this is not
the question. Mr Patten has put his
version of it out of the pale of propriety
by his mode of handling it.
There is nothing classical in his treatment,
nothing to redeem or elevate
the nudity and associations of the
subject. His Susannah is simply a
naked English girl, with a pretty
face, an immaculate cuticle, and something
exceedingly voluptuous in the
form and arrangement of her limbs.
There is no novelty of conception in
the picture, nor any particular merit
except the colouring, which is good,
but not equal to that in No. 446,
<em>Bacchus discovering the Use of the
Grape</em>. This is a pleasanter subject,
cleverly treated, displaying more originality
and much better taste. The
flesh-tints are capital, and the picture
altogether does credit to the painter.
<em>Venus and Cupid</em>, by the same artist,
is chiefly remarkable for a plaster-of-Paris
dove of an extraordinarily brilliant
and very unnatural effect. As
to Mr F. R. Pickersgill, we should
like his pictures better if he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
not imitate poor Etty, whose memory,
be it parenthetically observed, has
been little regarded by those who
have exhibited that most coarse and
unpleasant picture, <em>The Toilet</em>, No.
276, a specimen of the deceased
artist's worst manner. Mr Pickersgill's
<cite>Samson Betrayed</cite> is, there is no
denying it, a very unsatisfactory composition.
His red-haired Dalilah is
graceless and characterless. Samson,
recumbent in an attitude in which no
man ever slept soundly, seems prevented
only by a miracle from slipping
off her knees. Two girls, instead
of getting to a safe distance, are
hugging each other in terror within
reach of the giant's arm. There is
scarcely an attitude in the picture
that is not strained. In the conception
there is an utter want of novelty
of circumstance. The whole picture
is deficient in originality. The eye
wanders over it, seeking some feature
of special interest or striking beauty
whereon to dwell, and finds none.
Mr Pickersgill has good qualities,
but the spark of fancy and genius
which alone can complete the great
painter, is, we fear, wanting in his
composition.</p>

<p>We turn with pleasure to Leslie's
pictures. Were we disposed to find
fault with this very agreeable artist,
our objections could only be technical.
With want of imagination, and feeling
for beauty, none can tax him. Two
of his three pictures contain the sweetest
female faces in this exhibition.
How admirably has he interpreted
Shakspeare's description of Beatrice
stealing to the woodbine bower, to
play the eavesdropper on Hero and
Ursula.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Close by the ground."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">The painter has exactly rendered the
poet's graceful idea. As she glides
along, we seem to detect the slight flutter
and palpitation attendant on the
clandestine movement. Expression
and attitude are alike charming. Sophia
Western deserves even higher praise.
She is indeed a lovely creature. Tom
Jones bids her behold herself in the
mirror, and say whether such a face and
form do not guarantee his fidelity. It is
altogether a most agreeable composition;
and if we have any fault to find,
it is with the face of the enamoured
foundling, which wants refinement, and
has a sort of overgrown schoolboy's
ruddy fulness. Katherine of Arragon
beseeching Capucius to convey to
Henry VIII. her last recommendation
of her daughter and servants to his
goodness, is the most important of Mr
Leslie's pictures; and although by
many it will not be deemed the most
attractive, none can deny it great merit
and interest. The suffering countenance
of Katherine, and the tearful
faces of her attendants, are full of
expression. The ambassador is rather
tame, and one scarcely recognises in
his face or bearing the energy with
which he vows to do the bidding of the
unhappy queen.</p>

<p>Mr Eastlake has one scriptural and
one historical picture in this year's
exhibition. A passage from Sismondi,
telling the escape of an
Italian noble and his wife from
the persecution of the Duke of
Milan, has suggested the latter,
which is painted for the Vernon Gallery.
There is some good expression
in the faces in this picture, which has
more interest and novelty than its
companion <em>The Good Samaritan</em>, and
also greater vigour. Both show the
hand of the experienced and skilful
artist, although perhaps neither can
be classed amongst the best things he
has produced. We should gladly see
a little more nerve in Mr Eastlake's
style, and this we think might be
advantageously combined with his
beautiful transparency of colouring,
and other excellent qualities as a
painter. There is no diminution in the
purity of style and thought which has
always been one of his finest characteristics.</p>

<p>Mr Frith is an improving artist.
There is humour and progress in No.
543, a scene from Goldsmith's <em>Good-natured
Man</em>. <em>Mr Honeywood introduces
the bailiffs to Miss Richland as
his friends.</em> He must beware, however,
of running into caricature in
subjects of this kind. The bailiffs
are perhaps a little overdone. Miss
Richland has a very pretty face, but
she looks more like a <em>soubrette</em> or
smart actress than a woman of fashion.
Mr Frith's other picture, Sancho
proving to the duchess that Don
Quixote is at the bottom of the table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
is well painted, and, in a technical
point of view, it must be spoken of
with respect. He has not been quite so
successful as we should have expected
in the expression of the faces,&mdash;that
of the duke excepted, which is a good
and thoroughly Spanish countenance,
with its habitual gravity disturbed by
Sancho's quaint humour and his
master's manifest distress. But painting
ladies is not Mr Frith's forte.
His duchess is pretty, but there is a
want of aristocratic distinction in her
face and bearing; and as to the ladies
grouped behind her chair, they are
cookmaids in masquerade. Very few
living artists, besides Leslie, should
venture upon Sancho. We will not
say that Mr Frith is not one of those
few, but his delineation of the shrewd
esquire, although very humorous, is
rather coarse, and he has made him
ragged and filthy to an unnecessary
degree. The vexation and embarrassment
of Don Quixote are ludicrously
portrayed.</p>

<p>Four very small, very unpretending
pictures by Thomas Webster, R.A.,
must be sought for, but, when found,
cannot fail to be admired. They are
a feature, and a very charming one,
of this year's Exhibition. High finish
and truth to nature are their chief
characteristics. Mr Webster is getting
quite into the Ostade manner.
His colouring, too, is admirable. No.
54 is a boy in a chimney corner,
supping pottage, with an old woman
knitting opposite to him. Both faces
are excellent, and full of character.
<em>A Cherry Seller</em> is a perfect <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijou</i>&mdash;the
woman weighing out the fruit; the
boys, looking on with eager eyes and
watering mouths; the fruit itself, with
its Dutch nicety of finish:&mdash;altogether
it is a most desirable picture, such as
one can hardly pass, even for the
twentieth time, without pausing for
another view. <em>A Peasant's Home</em> is
upon the whole too gray, and perhaps
the least attractive of the four; but in
the <em>Farmhouse Kitchen</em> are a couple of
figures, a farmer and his dame, than
which nothing can be better, either
in colour or expression. Mr Webster
shows great taste and judgment in
adhering to a pleasing simplicity,
without ever falling into quaintness
or affectation. And it is a study for
a young artist to observe the skill
with which he throws his lights, and
the transparency and absence of
<em>paintyness</em> (to borrow a term from the
studio) which characterise his pictures.</p>

<p>Mr Solomon Hart's <em>Kitchen Interior
at Mayfield</em> will not do after Webster.
This, however, is one of the least
important of his six pictures, which
comprise two other interiors, two
heads, and a Jewish festival. This
last is perhaps the best picture he has
painted. The MSS. of the Pentateuch
are being carried round the synagogue
at Leghorn, amidst chanting
of hymns. There is a strong devotional
character in many of the faces;
and, as a work of art, the picture is
more than respectable. The interest
of the subject is a question of taste.
For us, we confess, it possesses very
little attraction; and the Jewish physiognomy,
so strongly marked as it is
in all the occupants of the synagogue,
is, to our thinking, incompatible with
beauty. We do not much admire
either <em>A Virtuoso or Arnolfo di Lapo</em>.
The latter is the best of the two: the
former, carefully painted, is merely an
ordinary-looking Jew.</p>

<p>What can we say of Mr Turner?
Perhaps we had better content ourselves
with mentioning that he has
four pictures in the Exhibition, all in
his latest manner, all illustrative of
that far-famed, but, unfortunately,
unpublished poem, <em>The Fallacies of
Hope</em>, and all proving the fallacy of
the hope we annually cherish that he
will abjure his eccentricities, and revert
to the style which justly gained
him his high reputation. It were absurd
of us to attempt to criticise his
present productions, for to us they are
unintelligible; and, judging from the
extremely puzzled looks we see fixed
upon them, we suspect that not many
of those who pause for their examination
are more successful than ourselves
in deciphering their meaning,
and in appreciating the beauties which
a few stanch adherents pretend to discover
in those strange compounds of
red, white, and yellow. What if Mr
Turner were to seek his inspirations
elsewhere than in the aforesaid MS.?
Can it be that the poet's halting verse
influences the painter's vagaries? From
the specimens afforded us, we are not
inclined to think highly of <em>The Fallacies of Hope</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
 Take the following, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exempli
gratiâ</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Beneath the morning mist<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Enough of such poetry, and enough,
as far as we are concerned, of a great
painter's unfortunate aberrations.</p>

<p>Apropos of aberrations, we have a
word to say, which may as well be
said here as elsewhere. Affectation,
however, is a more suitable word for
the mountebank proceedings of a
small number of artists, who, stimulated
by their own conceit, and
by the applause of a few foolish persons,
are endeavouring to set up a
school of their own. We allude,
to the pre-Raphaelites. Let not
Messrs Millais, Hunt, Rosetti, &amp;
Co. suppose, because we give them
an early place in this imperfect review
of the exhibitions, that we concede to
them an undue importance. As to
admiration, we shall presently make
them aware how far we entertain that
feeling towards them. Meanwhile, let
them not plume themselves on a place
amongst men of genius. Just as well
might they experience an exaltation
of their horns, because their absurd and
pretentious productions get casually
hung next to pictures by Landseer or
Webster. It appears they have got
into their wise heads certain notions
that the ideal of expression is to be
found in the works of the artists who
flourished previously to Raphael. And
they have accordingly set to work to
imitate those early masters, not only
in the earnestness of purpose visible
in their productions, but in their errors,
crudities, and imperfections&mdash;renouncing,
in fact, the progress that since
then has been made; rejecting the experience
of centuries, to revert for
models, not to art in its prime, but to
art in its uncultivated infancy. And a
nice business they make of it. Regardless
of anatomy and drawing,
they delight in ugliness and revel in
diseased aspects. Mr Dante Rosetti,
one of the high-priests of this retrograde
school, exhibits at the Portland
Gallery. Messrs Millais and Hunt
favour the saloons of the Academy.
Ricketty children, emaciation and
deformity constitute their chief stock
in trade. They apparently select bad
models, and then exaggerate their
badness till it is out of all nature. We
can hardly imagine anything more
ugly, graceless, and unpleasant than
Mr Millais' picture of Christ in the
carpenter's shop. Such a collection
of splay feet, puffed joints, and misshapen
limbs was assuredly never before
made within so small a compass.
We have great difficulty in believing
a report that this unpleasing and
atrociously affected picture has found
a purchaser at a high price. Another
specimen, from the same brush, inspires
rather laughter than disgust. A Ferdinand
of most ignoble physiognomy
is being lured by a pea-green monster
intended for Ariel; whilst a row of
sprites, such as it takes a Millais to
devise, watch the operation with turquoise
eyes. It would occupy more
room than the thing is worth to expose
all the absurdity and impertinence
of this work. Mr Hunt's picture
of a Christian Missionary sheltered
from Druid pursuit is in as ridiculous
taste as any of the group.</p>

<p>From such monstrosities it is a
relief to turn to Mr Frank Stone's
graceful creations. He also has taken
a subject from the second scene in the
<em>Tempest</em>, No. 342, Miranda's first
sight of Ferdinand. Compared with
Mr Millais' Ferdinand, that of Mr
Stone is a demigod. Estimated by its
intrinsic merits, it strikes us as a little
theatrical&mdash;rather too much of the
stage-player in the air and attitude.
Miranda has a sweet and youthful
face; Prospero is too young, and does
not look his part. This is not one of
Mr Stone's happiest efforts, but it is
a nice picture, and we prefer it to his
other in the same exhibition, <em>The
Gardener's Daughter</em>, a young lady
attitudinising under a rose-tree, with
a pair of admiring swains in the distance.
This artist is too apt to give
his male lovers a sickly look, as if their
love disagreed with them. The best
picture he has shown this year is one
in the British Institution&mdash;<em>Sympathy</em>&mdash;two
very pretty maidens, with an
expression of pleasing sentiment in
their faces. Barring a little occasional
mannerism, Mr Stone is a very delightful
painter; and in our opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
if he had had his deserts, he would
some time since have been a member
of the Academy. Were it not invidious,
we could cite a few, who write
<em>Associate</em> after their names, who have
less claim than he has to that honorary
distinction. Mr Stone has a great
deal of fancy, a fine feeling for the
beautiful, and we are indebted to him
for many charming compositions and
lovely female faces. And certainly
if popularity be a test of merit, which
we admit is not always the case, he
ought years ago to have figured in the
list of Academicians.</p>

<p>That very conscientious and careful
artist, Mr Charles Landseer, has
a pretty and well-painted <em>Girl in a
Hop-garden</em>, and a larger and still
better picture&mdash;perhaps the best he
has for some years produced&mdash;of
<em>Æsop</em>, surrounded by several of the
animals celebrated in his fables.
There is a great deal of quiet humour
and nice finish in this picture: the
figure and face of the hump-backed
fabulist, and those of a girl, who
seems admiringly to listen to his allegorical
wisdom, are exceedingly
good. Mr Dyce has only one picture,
and really that had been as well
away. An ugly Jacob is protruding
his lips to kiss a vulgar Rachel.
The colouring is hard and bad, and
there is a pervading gray tint
which is not natural. We hope Mr
Dyce, R.A., can do better things
than this. We prefer Mr Cope's
<em>King Lear</em>, which has considerable
merit. There is fine expression in
the old monarch's head. Cordelia
pleases us less; and perhaps, upon the
whole, the best figures in the picture
are those of the musicians and singers.
There is a something in this painting
that reminds us of Maclise. Of Mr
Cope's other pictures, <em>Milton's Dream</em>
has a nice tone of colour; and the
two sketches for fresco of Prince
Henry's submission to Judge Gascoigne,
and the Black Prince receiving
the order of the Garter, are spirited
and good. Mr Redgrave's
principal picture is No. 233. <em>The
Marquis having chosen patient Griselda
for his wife, causes the court
ladies to dress her in her father's cottage.</em>
Griselda has a pretty face, and
sits in an easy, graceful attitude: the
ladies are coarse, and the expression
of scorn upon their countenances is
theatrical and affected. The heads of
some of them are too big, and out of
proportion with their bodies. <em>The
Child's Prayer</em>, by the same artist, is
a pleasing picture; well painted, particularly
the woman's head and hand,
which latter has a look of Rubens.
Mr E. M. Ward has two pictures of
very different subjects. <em>Isaac Walton
Angling</em> hardly claims any particular
notice; <em>James II. receiving the News
of the Landing of the Prince of Orange
in 1688</em>, has more pretension and
greater merit. It certainly contains
good painting: the grouping of the
figures and the expression of some of
the faces are also praiseworthy; but
yet it hardly satisfies us. The queen's
face and attitude, as she advances,
already sympathising with the agitation
visible on his countenance, to
her husband's side, are very charming.
James's physiognomy is almost too
much discomposed to accord with the
passage from Dalrymple quoted by
Mr Ward. And it strikes us, although
this may seem hypercritical,
that there is something ludicrous in
the eternal suspension in the air of
the letter that he has just allowed
to escape from his fingers. Upon the
whole, however, this is a clever picture,
and, as far as we had opportunity
of observing, it attracts a very
full share of public attention; although
that is no criterion of merit, so
large a proportion of the loungers
through an exhibition being more
readily attracted by a piquant subject
than by artistical skill. And
probably no subjects are more generally
popular than those that may be
styled the homely-historical; scenes in
the private apartments of royalty; the
personal adventures and perils of
princes, whether in the palace or the
prison&mdash;on the steps of the throne or
the verge of the scaffold. There is a
fair sprinkling of such pictures in the
four exhibitions now under notice; and
as we have no pretension to be otherwise
than exceedingly desultory in
this article, whose limits, and the
heterogeneous subject, preclude our
being otherwise, we will at once dispose
of such of them as deserve notice,
and have not already received
it, commencing, in order of catalogue,
with Delaroche's picture of <em>Cromwell</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
<em>looking at the dead body of Charles I.</em>
This is a picture concerning which the
most conflicting opinions have been
uttered. It has received fulsome
praise and unwarranted abuse. Some
have lauded it as perfection merely
because it is by Paul Delaroche;
others have decried it with a virulence
and injustice warranting the
suspicion that some envious brother
of the brush had temporarily abandoned
the palette for the pen, and
applied himself to slander merit he
himself was hopeless of equalling.
We are aware but of two valid objections
that can fairly be made to the
picture. The subject is certainly
ghastly and horrid; but, on the other
hand, it has been rendered as little so
as possible by the consummate skill
and good taste of its treatment. And
none, we think, but the very fastidious,
will dwell upon this point. The
other objection (technical only) is to
the coppery tone of colouring of certain
parts of the picture, particularly
of the flesh. This premised, we are
aware of little else that can fairly be
alleged against this very fine picture.
The countenance of Cromwell certainly
does not agree with the most
authentic portraits that have been
handed down to us, or with the
written and traditional accounts of
his features. The artist has idealised
his hero&mdash;has abridged his nose, increased
his under jaw, and thrown
nearly the whole expression of the
face into and around the mouth. M.
Delaroche having taken such liberties,
we ought to be particularly
grateful to him that he has not gone
farther, and, in aiming at a great
effect, fallen into exaggeration. Out
of twenty French artists, nineteen,
we suspect, would have given us,
with the strong and dangerous temptation
of so striking a subject, an
unpleasant caricature. It has been
objected that the face is deficient in
character and expression, and would
perfectly suit any one of Cromwell's
Ironsides, who through curiosity
should have lifted the lid of the
deceased monarch's coffin. It is, to
our thinking, an evidence of skill on
the part of the painter thus to have
left the expression doubtful&mdash;a matter
of speculation to the beholder.
We interpret it as merely meditative.
Any emotion it includes is one of
exultation at the great and important
step the Usurper has made in his upward
progress. Of pity or remorse
there is no trace.</p>

<p>The next picture in the Exhibition
of the Academy, of the class at present
under notice, that particularly
caught our eye, is No. 491, <em>The
Burial of the two sons of Edward IV.
in the Tower</em>, by Mr Cross, whose
painting of Richard C&oelig;ur-de-Lion,
exhibited at Westminster Hall, will
be remembered by many of our
readers. The present picture does
not redeem the promise of its predecessor.
It has a washy, fresco-like
look, and a great want of light and
shade, which is the more striking because
the subject is one particularly
favourable to the display of a Rembrandt-like
vigour in that respect. The
arrangement of the dead bodies is
very bad, and they have an emaciated
look which was quite uncalled for.
On the other hand, the faces of two
of the murderers, (one sustains the
stone beneath which the grave is dug,
and the other grasps the arm of one
of the children,) and that of the
turnkey, are very expressive. The
chief of the gang and the grave-digger
are rather strained and theatrical.
Upon the whole, the picture disappoints
us much. A report, however,
has reached us, that it was
painted under the disadvantage of ill
health, so we will hope that Mr
Cross may yet do better things.
No. 569, <em>The Abdication of Mary
Queen of Scots at Lochleven Castle</em>, by
J. Severn, is a very tame affair.
And we do not greatly admire Mr
Lucy's <em>Parting of Charles I. with his
Children</em>. The subject has been better
treated before. But we delight
in Mr Joy's conception of Cromwell
coveting, and yet daring not to
grasp, the crown of England. A
bilious misanthrope, with flabby
cheeks and lacklustre eye, is seated
beside a table on which stands the
crown, whose covering he has partly
withdrawn. The notion is amusingly
matter-of-fact. Does Mr Joy really
suppose that such a man as Cromwell
could find enjoyment in the deliberate
physical contemplation of the
jewelled bauble&mdash;the substantial
crown&mdash;the mere emblem of the dignity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and sway for which he thirsted?
We cannot compliment this artist on
either the conceit or the execution.
We prefer his picture in the British
Institution, although that is not very
remarkable. The subject is the interview
between James IV. of Scotland
and the outlaw Murray on the
banks of Yarrow. In this Exhibition
we find another Cromwell, of a
very different cast from the one just
referred to. The Lord Protector of
England dictates to John Milton his
celebrated despatch in favour of the
persecuted Piedmontese Protestants.
Here there is a fire and energy mingled
with the coarseness of Cromwell's
physiognomy, which gives the
character of the man as we read of him
and believe him to have been. Milton's
face wears a look of gentle enthusiasm
and approval, as he admiringly
weighs the words that fall from
the lips of his great patron. In his
eyes there is a sort of haziness that
seems to foreshadow the darkness
which later is to come over him. The
picture does great credit to a very
rising artist, Mr F. Newenham, who
also exhibits a painting at the Portland
Gallery, which we like quite
as well as his Cromwell. The subject,
<em>The Princes in the Tower</em>, is not
a very new one, but there is imagination
and novelty in its treatment.
It is just the same point of time that
Delaroche has chosen in his painting
of this subject, but there is nothing
like an imitation of the great Frenchman.
Here the younger child still
sleeps, whilst the elder, a princely-looking
lad, roused by the noise at
the door, gazes anxiously, rather than
fearfully, at the shadow cast upon the
wall by a hand bearing a lantern.
The picture is suggestive and interesting,
and in an artistic point of view,
also, it merits high praise. In this
Portland Gallery (which we may
observe, by the way, is most excellently
constructed and lighted for the
advantageous exhibition of works of
art) is a painting by Mr Claxton,
<em>Marie Antoinette with her Children, escaping
by the Secret Door from her
apartment in Versailles, when the
palace was attached by the mob</em>, which
we mention rather on account of the
interest of the subject than of its merits
as a work of art, these being but of a
negative description. Marie Antoinette,
dressed rather like a fashionable
of the year 1850, is accompanied
by a terrified lady, who looks back at
the door, half-masked by smoke,
through whose broken pannel the
bayonets of the rebels cross with those
of the loyal grenadiers. Another
picture from French history, but selected
from a much remoter period, is
that of <em>The Excommunication of Robert,
King of France, and his Queen
Bertha</em>, (No. 159 in the Portland
Gallery.) which Mr Desanges has
executed with some skill. The king,
having married his cousin in defiance
of the Pope, but with the sanction of
three prelates of his kingdom, incurs
the pontifical anathema, in common
with the prelates and royal family.
In the picture, the fiat has just been
pronounced, and the extinction of
their torches by the officiating priests
symbolically completes their mission.</p>

<p>This is not one of Mr Clarkson
Stanfield's best years. We prefer
this careful and able artist on a grander
scale than that of the comparatively
small pictures he this year exhibits.
Nor do we think he has been particularly
happy in his choice of subjects.
His scene from Macbeth,
viewed as a landscape&mdash;for we do not
take into account the figures, which
are insignificant, and might as well
have been left out&mdash;is a good picture,
but not in his happiest taste. We
prefer his <em>Scene on the Maas</em>, and his
<em>Bay of Baiæ</em>, which are both excellent.
No. 288, <em>Near Foria</em>, is not a
very good subject. But Mr Stanfield
is a pleasant, natural painter, quite
free from affectation, and a most excellent
representative of the English
school. Mr Roberts is another favourite
of ours. Belgium and the East,
Egyptian temples and Catholic
shrines, furnish subjects for his seven
pictures. What we particularly like
in him is the strong impression of
correctness and fidelity conveyed by
his representations of distant scenes.
Without having seen the places, one
feels convinced of the accuracy of his
delineations, and that he gives the
real effect of the objects depicted&mdash;just
as, in certain portraits, one feels
certain of the resemblance without
knowing the original. The subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of his pictures this year do not demand
any detailed criticism, and his
good qualities are so universally appreciated
as to render general commendation
superfluous.</p>

<p>Before passing on to landscapes
and portraits we will glance at a few
pictures of various classes, which
happen to have attracted our attention,
and which deserve better or
worse than to be left unnoticed.
Diving into the gloom of the Octagon,
we are struck by the very remarkable
merit of two pictures, which ought
never to have been placed there.
Only by kneeling or sitting upon the
ground is it possible to examine Mr
Van Schendel's poacher detected,
No. 633, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un Braconnier au moment
qu'on vient le prendre</i>. Of ordinary
visitors to the Exhibition, not one in
five will notice the existence of the
picture&mdash;not one in twenty, probably,
will go through the painful contortions
requisite to get even a bad view
of it. Very few, if any, critics will
have sought it out or written a comment
on it. Yet this is a picture on
which greater talent and labour have
been expended than on dozens that
hang in conspicuous places and good
lights. A dark picture, too&mdash;a night
scene&mdash;it required a strong light; and
it was most unjust to put it thus in
the very darkest nook, and in the
lowest range of the whole Academy.
For hospitality's sake to a foreigner,
this excellent painting should have
been differently placed. The only
other picture which we noticed in
the Octagon&mdash;there may be others of
great merit, but we never have patience
to linger long in the gloomy
closet&mdash;is No. 586, <i>Flowers and Fruit</i>,
by T. Groenland&mdash;an artist far superior
to Lance, who seems to us to fall
off instead of improving. Fruit and
flower pieces are things that few
people care much to look at&mdash;and, for
our part, we confess that we seldom
afford them more than a very cursory
glance; but our attention was seriously
and pleasingly arrested by both
of those exhibited this year by Mr
Groenland, remarkable, as they are,
not only for the accuracy with which
he imitates the texture of the different
fruits&mdash;whether pulpiness, bloom,
or transparency be their chief characteristic&mdash;and
for the admirable delicacy
of his flower-painting, but also
for his skill in elevating and giving
interest to the walk of art he has
chosen. This is strikingly the case in
No. 1254, apropos of which we have
another piece of injustice or carelessness&mdash;let
them call it which they like&mdash;to
notice on the part of the Hanging
Committee. Of all the seven
rooms of the Academy, not one is so
little visited as that which, in the catalogue,
is headed Architecture. Accordingly,
the hangmen have placed at
one end of it five as pleasing pictures&mdash;each
in its own style&mdash;as any in
the Exhibition. Here we have the
<em>Vierge Route du Simplon</em>, a charming
airy landscape by Harding;
<em>Esther</em>, by O'Neil, one of the best,
perhaps, he ever did; <em>The Port of
Marseilles</em>, by E. W. Cooke, very
like and very well painted, with excellent
water; <em>A Winter Evening</em>, by
H. Horsley, a most clever piece of
snow scenery, with a cold look that
makes one shiver, and a capital effect
of setting sun through an archway;
and, last in our enumeration, but
not in merit, Mr Groenland's second
fruit and flower piece, with a landscape
background, a gorgeous and
life-like peacock, a flush of rhododendrons,
and painstaking and talent in
every leaf and flower. Another picture
in the same vicinity, by W.
Fisher, <em>The Coulin</em>, a subject taken
from Moore's melodies, is rather affected,
but by no means destitute of
merit.</p>

<p>Mr Martin's picture, <em>The Last Man</em>,
is far from one of his best. The subject
is unpleasing, and there is a decided
fault of perspective; the human
corpses and carcasses of strange beasts,
in the foreground, being much too
small in proportion with the figure of
the man, who stands on an elevation
which is doubtless intended to be
much in advance of, but which in
reality is almost on a line with, the
spot where they are spread pellmell
in grisly confusion. Mr Hannah's
<em>Lady Northumberland and Lady Percy
dissuading the Earl from joining the
wars against Henry IV.</em> is oddly
coloured, and acquires a cold, insipid
look from the profusion of blue and
gray; but it is a good and clever picture.
A similar class of subject has
been selected by Mr T. J. Barker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
from Professor Aytoun's ballad of
<em>Edinburgh after Flodden</em>. Randolph
Murray, bearing news of the defeat, is
the centre of a throng anxious even
to agony.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Why art thou alone, unfollowed?<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Is it weal, or is it woe?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">Perched up as this picture is
above the door in the West Room,
it is difficult to arrive at a correct
appreciation of it. As far as we
could distinguish, it is not without
merit, and the expression of exhaustion
in the figure of Murray is
pretty well rendered; but altogether
it is hardly worthy of the nervous and
admirable verse it is intended to illustrate.
Mr Armitage's <em>Aholibah</em> has a
good deal of pretension, but we cannot
compliment him on it in any one
respect. In the first place the subject
is disgusting, and shows wretched
taste in the artist who would select it.
Then the face of Aholibah is ugly and
repulsive, and the expression coarse in
the extreme: the drawing of the
limbs under the drapery is faulty, and
the gazelles are out of place and out
of perspective. Mr Armitage can do
better than this. We prefer his picture
in the Portland Gallery, of Samson
tying firebrands to the foxes' tails
for the destruction of the Philistine
crops; although the face is a great
deal too black, and we cannot understand
why Samson should allow a
fox to bite into the muscle of his
thigh, as one of those in his grasp appears
to do. Why does Mr Armitage
persist in his French style of painting?
It is quite a mistake. Let him
be natural, and rely upon his own
taste and judgment, and we think he
may do better things.</p>

<p>Mr Hook's <em>Dream of Venice</em>, a
clever imitation of Paul Veronese, is
a very pleasant picture. Mr F. Williams'
<em>Holy Maiden</em> is a pretty head,
full of sentiment. We are glad to see
such good promise given by Mr Leslie,
junior, in a very humorous picture
entitled <em>A Sailor's Yarn</em>. A thoroughbred
and unmistakeable Cockney
greedily listens to some astounding
narrative, whilst, behind the credulous
landsman, a second sailor grins admiration
of his messmate, and contempt
for the "green hand." <em>The Young
Student</em>, by W. Gush, is a very nice
picture of a youthful painter, with an
artist's eye and a pleasing Vandykish
contour of face, and with carefully
painted hands. One of the most
comical pictures in the Exhibition is a
wild boar by Wolf. The bristly
forest-ranger is making its way
through the deep snow, leaving a long
furrow behind it, along which it has
apparently been nuzzling for provender,
for its snout is garnished with
the snow, which, combined with the
sudden fore-shortening of the body,
produces a ludicrous effect. No. 121,
<em>Autumn&mdash;Wounded Woodcock</em>, from
the same hand, has mellow and natural
tints.</p>

<p>We have kept back, almost to the
last, one of our chief favourites in the
Exhibition of the Royal Academy.
Mr Sidney Cooper is in great force
this year. He has six pictures;
four of them all his own, two painted
in conjunction with Mr F. R. Lee,
R.A. With all respect for this artist,
to whose landscapes we shall refer in
their place, we prefer Cooper alone
to Cooper in partnership. The two
styles do not blend well, nor does
Lee put his best landscapes into
Cooper's cattle-pieces. Take the first
of their pictures&mdash;No. 23&mdash;<em>Cattle crossing
a Ford</em>. As a whole it is agreeable&mdash;and
the cattle, we need hardly say,
are worthy of the best English cattle-painter
of the day; but the landscape
is feeble. In No. 298, <em>The Watering-place</em>,
the rather heavy paint of the
foliage gives a thin washy look to the
foreground. We advise Messrs Lee
and Cooper to hang their pictures
side by side, if they will, as excellent
specimens of their respective walks
of art, but not to associate themselves
on the same canvass. People find
fault with the landscape part of
Cooper's pictures; but it is in good
keeping with the rest, and moreover
he improves in that respect, as in
others. We will instance No. 278,
<em>A Mountain Group&mdash;Evening</em>, some
charming goats, where the background,
bathed in soft light, harmonises
admirably with the more
prominent parts of the picture. No.
454, <em>A Group on the Welsh Mountains</em>,
is most delicately finished, quite a
gem; and <em>Fordwick Meadows&mdash;Sunset</em>,
in a somewhat broader style, is equally
excellent. Mr Cooper's is a class of art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
which strongly appeals to the domestic
and rural tastes of Englishmen. He
excels in it, and need fear no competitors,
although several artists this
year exhibit cattle-landscapes of some
merit. And here we should perhaps
say a word about Mr Ansdell, who
has put some Brobdignagian sheep
into a landscape by Mr Creswick,
(British Institution, No. 123, <em>Southdowns</em>,)
and who has rather a pretty
thing in the same exhibition&mdash;No. 40,
<em>The Regretted Companion</em>&mdash;an old
hawker perplexed and mournful
beside the body of his dead ass. We
would gladly see this artist cease to
imitate Landseer. He sacrifices his
originality without succeeding in
catching the best points of his model.</p>

<p>Nos. 80, 405, 407 in the catalogue
of the Academy, are Mr Lee's landscapes&mdash;uncombined
with Cooper's
cattle. The second, <em>A Calm Morning</em>,
is the one we prefer; and a very
charming picture of repose it is. Mr
Creswick is the next upon our list.
His cold unnatural grayness of
colouring greatly detracts from the
merit of his pictures. We are quite
aware that the same reproach has
been repeatedly addressed to him,
and we should hardly have referred
to a fault which hitherto he has
either obstinately clung to, or been
unable to correct, did not one of his
pictures in the Academy this year
give us hopes that he is on the verge
of a change. No. 542, <em>A Forest Farm</em>,
is the best picture of Creswick's, in
point of colouring, that we remember
to have seen. The <em>slaty</em> look is
replaced by an agreeable transparency.
No. 289, <em>In the Forest</em>, is also warmer
than usual. The others are in the
old style. Mr Linnell is more to our
taste, although we cannot approve his
<em>Christ and the Woman of Samaria
at Jacob's Well</em>. In the first place the
colour seems unnatural, altogether
too brown; at the same time it is
just possible nature may assume that
extraordinarily russet tint in Samaria&mdash;a
country to which our travels
have not extended. But we can
more confidently object to the
figure of the Saviour as altogether
unpleasant, with a harsh darkly-bearded
face, devoid alike of resemblance
to the received type, and of
any divine expression whatever.
Mr Linnell is a landscape-painter,
and should not attempt sacred subjects
or portraits, things which are quite
out of his line. No. 395, <em>Crossing
the Brook</em>, is of a better tone of
colour; and the same artist has two
other pictures, of about his usual
average of merit, in the British
Institution. The chief fault with
which we tax Mr Linnell, (whilst freely
admitting his great talent,) and one
which may also be imputed to Mr
Creswick, and to other clever landscape-painters
of the present day, is
the undeviating smallness of their
touch, which gives, to use a colloquialism,
a niggled look to their
pictures. Hobbima, and Ruysdael,
and others of that class&mdash;in whose
footsteps we presume no living
landscape-painter is too proud to
tread&mdash;avoided this fault, and proportioned
the fulness of their touch
to the size of their picture. We
may select an example of what we
mean from the works of an able and
industrious artist, who figures advantageously
this year in all four exhibitions,
and who, in most instances, is
very free from the defect we refer
to. Mr Sidney Percy's <em>Woodland
River</em>, No. 207, in the Portland
Gallery, is a good picture, but to
our thinking the touch is too small
for the size. Mr Percy, however,
is a man of talent and a rising
painter. In the same gallery we
call attention, as to one of the best
landscapes exhibited this year, to his
No. 277, <em>Welsh Mountains</em>. There is
an effect of aërial perspective in this
picture, especially in the grass valley,
on the spectator's left hand, which
deserves the very highest praise.
Several others of his eighteen pictures
for 1850 deserve much commendation;
but we can only point out
No. 576, in the Academy, <em>A Limpid
Pool</em>, and 394, <em>A Quiet Vale</em>, in
the British Artists'. The water in
the last is very good,&mdash;otherwise it is
hardly one of his best. We would
have Mr Percy to beware of hardness
of treatment, the fault to which he is
most prone. His lines are apt to be
too sharply defined, especially his
distant outlines. He should guard
himself against this defect, and with
care he may expect to attain great
eminence as a landscape-painter. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
we mistake not, he is one of a talented
family, which also comprises Messrs
Boddington and Gilbert, and several
artists of the name of Williams, all
of whom, we believe, devote themselves
chiefly, if not exclusively, to
landscape-painting, and either by
identity of name or affinity of style,
form a most puzzling group for conscientious
critics, desirous, like ourselves,
to sort their works and fairly
distribute praise. We can mention
but a few of their pictures, taken,
nearly at random, from amongst a
number we have marked as of merit
or promise. In the Academy, 344,
<em>A Valley Lane</em>, by A. W. Williams,
is a charming subject, excellently
treated. In the Portland Gallery,
where many good landscapes are to
be found, most of them by this
family, we were particularly attracted
by No. 41, <em>Noon</em>, also by A. W.
Williams, and by No. 65, <em>Medmenham
Abbey&mdash;Evening</em>, by G. A.
Williams. No. 161, <em>A Showery Afternoon
in Sussex</em>, by A. Gilbert, is
remarkable as an example of the
admirable effect he knows how to
produce by the judicious and little-understood
application of the various
gradations between opacity and perfect
transparency of colour. Mr
Boddington has two nice pictures in
the Academy.</p>

<p>We cannot compliment Mr F.
Danby on either of the two specimens
of his art that he this year displays.
We find it impossible to comprehend
his colouring. That of <em>A Golden
Moment</em> (British Institution) is surely
unnatural. Certainly it is a very rare
effect of sunset; and the background is
too bright to be consistent with the
sombre foreground. If we turn to his
picture in the Academy, <em>Spring</em>, we
are no better pleased. That sort of
dusky glow is quite an exaggeration
of nature. Of Mr Witherington's
four pictures, we prefer <em>Coniston
Lake</em> and <em>The Mountain Road</em>. Mr
Hering's <em>Porto Fesano</em> (British Institution)
is a pleasing picture, and
improves on examination; and there
is a great deal of light and some
pretty colour in the same artist's
<em>Ruins of Rome</em> in the Academy. Mr
J. Peel has rather a pretty <em>Canal view</em>
in the Portland Gallery, in which,
oddly enough, he has thrown the shadow
of a tree the wrong way; and
in the same exhibition Mrs Oliver
has a bit of Welsh scenery which
is pretty in spite of its finical touch.
Of Mr Linton, who has pictures both
in the Academy and British Institution,
we cannot but speak with respect,
recognising the ability of his
works, the study they evince, and his
close observation of the aspect of
places. But they are quite for distant
effect; on near approach they look
rough and granitic, and are not a very
pleasing or popular class of pictures.</p>

<p>We beg Mr Boxall not to think
we have forgotten him. We were
desirous to commence the brief paragraph
we can afford to portraits, by
praising his <em>Geraldine</em>, an undraped
fancy portrait, which shows a capital
feeling for colour, and is perhaps the
best specimen of flesh-painting in the
Exhibition. It wants finish; but
even without that it is nearly the first
thing that attracts the eye when we
glance at that side of the Middle Room.
There is good colour also in the same
artist's portrait of Mr Cubitt.</p>

<p>Proceeding, with this exception, in
numerical rotation, we notice No. 6,
<em>The Hon. Caroline Dawson</em>, by
Dubufe. The arms are rather flat,
but it is a nice portrait, well painted,
and infinitely superior to the same
artist's picture in the British Institution&mdash;a
French grisette with a Jewish
face and an ugly mouth, holding a
rose; the motto "Wither one rose
and let the other flourish,"&mdash;a poor
conceit and very indifferently executed.
No. 52 is Mr Francis Grant's,
the first, but not the best, of seven
which he exhibits. Mr Grant is getting
very careless. Such hands and
clothes as he gives his sitters are really
not allowable. The only carefully
finished portrait he exhibits this year
is that of Lady Elizabeth Wells, after
which that of Miss Grant is perhaps
the best. The Countess Bruce has
an odd sort of resemblance, in the
attitude or something, to the same
painter's picture of Mr Sidney Herbert.
The Duke of Devonshire looks vulgar.
Viscount Hardinge is feeble, for Grant,
who can do so much better. We urge
this artist to take a little more pains,
or his high reputation will dwindle.
His portrait of Sir George Grey, now
on view at Colnaghi's, is another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
example of carelessness. The face is
the only finished part. Mr Watson
Gordon understands the portrait-painter's
vocation after a different
fashion, and is most conscientious in
his practice. Apart from their striking
resemblance, his portraits are
admirable as carefully finished works
of art. His sitters this year have
been, upon the whole, less suited to
make interesting or pleasing pictures
than several of the persons who have
sat to Mr Grant; but Watson Gordon
has done his work far more carefully.
Perhaps the best of his three portraits
is that of a lady, No. 137. The child
in the same picture pleases us rather
less. No. 175, Daniel Vere, Esq. of
Stonebyres, is a striking likeness of
that gentleman; and nothing can be
better, in all respects, than the portrait
of the Lord Justice-General of Scotland.
Mr Buckner is, we are sorry to
say, retrograding sadly. He rose
very suddenly into public favour,
and if he does not take care, he
will rapidly decline. His portrait
of Miss Lane Fox is perhaps his
best this year. Rachel is flattered.
Lady Alfred Paget is badly coloured,
and looks in an incipient stage of blue
cholera. We do not like Mr Pickersgill's
portraits this year. For those
who do, there are seven in the Exhibition,
besides an ugly thing called
Nourmahal. Mr G. F. Watts has
painted Miss Virginia Pattle. It is
one of the most affected pictures in
the whole Exhibition. The young
lady is perched on a platform, her
figure standing out against the blue
sky, and her feet completely hidden
under her dress, which latter circumstance
gives her an unsteady
appearance, and inspires dread lest she
should be blown from her elevation.
The flesh is very pasty, and the
general effect of the picture jejune in
the extreme. No. 282, <em>The Duke
of Aumale</em>, is by V. Mottez, and presents
a singular combination or monotony
of colour, the artist having seemingly
carefully avoided all tints that
would give warmth to his picture.
With the exception of the insipidly
fair countenance of the Duke, the
painting is nearly all blue. It is
not a disagreeable picture, and it
perhaps gains on repeated examination;
but one cannot get rid of an
unpleasant impression of coldness.
Placed next to Boxall's Geraldine, the
flesh looks like chalk. That coarse
but clever painter Knight has eight
portraits, including several celebrities
of one kind or other&mdash;Buckstone the
comedian, Keate the surgeon, Sir J.
Duke the mayor, Cooper the cattle-painter,
and Mrs Fitzwilliam the
actress. The picture of Sir J. Duke
(who is represented in all the glory of
civic office) is well put together;
Cooper is laughably like; Mrs Fitzwilliam
is perhaps as delicate a female
portrait as Knight ever painted&mdash;which
is not saying much for the others.
Mr Say's portrait of Guizot is softened
down and idealised till the character
of the man is lost. In the Portland
Gallery, No. 1 and No. 70 are by
an artist whose historical pictures we
have already commended, Mr Newenham.
The first is a full length, size
of life, of Mr Ross, the engineer; the
other, Mrs Gall, is a sweet female
countenance. Both are very good;
but Mr Newenham is always particularly
successful&mdash;indeed we can call to
mind no living painter who is more so&mdash;in
his portraits of ladies. Whilst
avoiding flattery, he still invariably
paints pleasing as well as correct likenesses.
Such at least is the case with
all those of his lady-portraits we have
had opportunities of comparing with
the models. Middleton has some nice
portraits in this exhibition, and Mr J.
Lucas shows a pleasing one of a young
lad. And one of the most lifelike and
speaking portraits exhibited this year
is No. 286, by R. S. Lauder, the likeness
of our old friend and much-esteemed
contributor, the Rev. James
White. A more exact resemblance
we never saw.</p>

<p>We have not counted them, but we
are informed, and have no difficulty in
believing, that there are 450 portraits
(or thereabouts) in this the eighty-second
exhibition of the Royal Academy.
A very large number, out of
1456 works of art. Adding the portraits
in the three other exhibitions,
we attain a total of which, even after
deducting drawings and miniatures, it
is impossible for us to notice one fourth-part.
And we must particularly remark,
with respect to portraits and
landscapes, what also applies in a less
degree to the less numerous classes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
pictures, that we have unavoidably&mdash;on
account of our limited space to
deal with so compendious a subject,
and also because we would not reduce
this article to a mere catalogue&mdash;omitted
notice of many artists and
pictures whose claims are undoubted
to mention more or less honourable;
as we have also forborne, for the same
reason, and much more willingly,
certain censures which we should have
been justified in inflicting. Concerning
portraits, however, we would gladly
have been rather more diffuse, had
we not still to take some notice, within
the compass of a very few pages, of
those exhibitions to which as yet we
have done little more than incidentally
refer.</p>

<p>The restoration to the galleries of
purchasers and studios of painters, of
the five hundred pictures exhibited this
year by the British Institution, diminishes
the interest now attaching to
that exhibition, and induces us to be
tolerably brief in our notice of some of
its leading features. No. 52, <em>The Post
Office</em>, by F. Goodall, is a pretty
picture enough, but displays no genius,
and the subject suggests a comparison
with Wilkie, which is not favourable.
Mr Bullock's <em>Venus and Cupid</em>, No.
124, is about as sickly a piece of blue
and pink as we remember to have seen.
Mr Sant's <em>Rivals</em> gives the impression
of a copy from the lid of a French
plum-box. We have surely seen the
Frenchified group in some engraving
of Louis XV's times. Mr Woolmer's
<em>Syrens</em> displays some imagination, but
the colouring is very bad. The sky is
exaggerated, and the water seems to
have flowed from a cesspool, suggesting
unsavoury ideas of the extent of its
contamination by the dead bodies that
float upon it. It is a picture, nevertheless,
that one is apt to look at
twice. T. Clark's <em>The Horses of
Rhesus captured by Ulysses and
Diomed</em>, has plenty of faults, certainly,
but it has also boldness and spirit, and
makes us think the painter may hereafter
do better things. No. 205, <em>Lance
reproving his Dog</em>&mdash;left unfinished by
the late Sir A. W. Callcott, and completed
by J. Callcott Horsley&mdash;includes
a pretty bit of landscape, and the dog
is not bad; but, as a whole, the picture
does not strike us as remarkable. No.
231, <em>A French Fishing Girl</em>, by T. K.
Fairless, is a nice bit of colouring, very
fresh and judicious; and R. M'Innes's
<em>Detaining a Customer</em>, tells its story
well, and is of careful finish, but insipid
colouring. Lady Macbeth, by T. F.
Dicksee, is repulsive and unnatural; not
the murderess Shakspeare conceived
and Siddons acted, but a saucer-eyed
maniac standing under a gas-lamp.
No. 290, <em>Our Saviour after the Temptation</em>,
is by Sir George Hayter, who has
bestowed great pains without producing,
as a whole, a very satisfactory
result. The picture has certainly good
points, but it speaks against its general
excellence that we are driven to praise
details. All the hands are particularly
well done&mdash;Sir George's experience as
a portrait painter having here availed
him. The colouring of Christ's dress
is good, but generally there is an
abuse of yellow in the picture. The
angels have no backs to their heads,
but this phrenological defect is perhaps
intentional, to convey the artist's
notion of an angel by indicating the
absence of gross passions. G. Cole's
<em>Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in
Pedro's hut</em> is humorous, but quite a
caricature. The painter seems to have
studied to establish a resemblance
between the men and their respective
beasts. Another laughable picture is
Mrs C. Smith's <em>Irish Piper</em>, whose
companion <em>The Irish Card-cutter</em> is
No. 206 in the British Artists'. As
works of art, they have little merit, but
one cannot help acknowledging and
laughing at the vulgar humour and
truth to nature they both contain.
Mr Selous' <em>The First Impression</em>,
Gutemberg showing to his wife his
first experiment in printing from
movable types, is perhaps the best
picture in the South Room. There is
an air of nature about Mr W. Wyld's
<em>Smugglers' halt in the Sierra Morena</em>;
but the figures, although well grouped,
are on too small a scale for much
interest, and the landscape lacks
attraction. Our old friend George
Cruikshank gives full scope to his rich
humour in No. 100, <em>Sancho's surprise
on seeing the Squire of the Wood's Nose</em>;
and 455, <em>Disturbing the Congregation</em>.
This last is inimitable&mdash;brimful of fun.
A charity boy has let his peg-top fall
during service, and the awful clatter
upon the church pavement draws all
eyes in the direction of the delinquent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
This is a picture that must be seen,
not described; but our readers will
imagine all the fun Cruikshank would
make of such a subject&mdash;the terrified
face of the culprit, in vain affecting
unconsciousness, and the awful countenance
of the beadle. We must say
a word of Mr J. F. Herring's <em>A Farmyard</em>,
which contains some good
horses; but he has huddled his
objects too much together, his colouring
is very opaque, and there is a
want of air and perspective in the
picture. There is the same defect
of thick colour in Mr H. Jutsum's
pretty composition, <em>Evening&mdash;coming
home to the Farm</em>.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned several
pictures in the Portland Gallery, including
a portrait by Mr R. S. Lauder,
(the president of this new society,)
which is perhaps the best, although
one of the most unpretending, of the
seven pictures he exhibits. We do
not discern any very great merit in
two carefully painted illustrations of
Quentin Durward. We should like
to know on what authority Mr Lauder
makes a tall, large-limbed man of
Louis XI., and how he intends to get
him and the raw-boned Scot through
the door in No. 166, without a most
unkingly deviation from the perpendicular.
There is here a fault of
perspective. And Mr Lauder should
beware of repetition. We remember
the lady behind the tapestry in No.
45, in at least a dozen of his pictures.
This, however, is the best of the pair,
and there is good painting in it. His
most important picture this year is
that of <em>Christ appearing to two of his
Disciples on the way to Emmaus</em>. This
is certainly a fine work, although
there is much opposition of opinion
respecting it. There is undoubtedly
a fine sentiment in the colouring,
which is peculiarly applicable to the
subject. Mr M'Ian is in great force
here, with no less than ten pictures.
We like this artist for the character
and energy he infuses into his productions.
His most attractive picture
this year is No. 55, <em>Here's his
health in Water!</em> thus explained&mdash;"A
Highland gentleman of 1715, in
Carlisle prison, the day previous to
his execution, receiving the last visit
of his mother, wife, and children, and
instilling into his son&mdash;the future
Highland gentleman of 1745&mdash;the
principles of loyalty." The face of
the condemned Highlander is full of
vigour and determination, as is also
that of his mother, a resolute old
lady, who seems to confirm his precepts
to her grandchild. The countenances
of the sorrowing wife and of
the little girl, whose attention is distracted
by the opening of the prison
door, are natural and pleasing. The
boy, a sturdy scion of the old stock,
drinks King James's health out of the
prison-mug of water. We will not
omit to praise Mrs M'Ian's very well-painted
picture of <em>Captivity and Liberty</em>&mdash;gipsies
in prison, with swallows
twittering in the loophole that affords
them light. There is a nice feeling
about this picture, which includes a
handsome gipsy face; it is careful in its
details, and very effective in point of
chiaroscuro. No. 251, <em>A Jealous Man,
disguised as a Priest, hears the confession
of his Wife</em>, is a subject (from
the <em>Decameron</em>) of which more might
have been made than there has been
by Mr D. W. Deane. The countenances
lack decided expression.
Several artists have this year painted
scenes from the <em>Tempest</em>, and Mr
A. Fussell is one of the number. It
were to be wished he had abstained.
His picture of <em>Caliban, Ariel, and his
fellows</em>, is very bad indeed. He should
be less ambitious in his subjects, or
at least less fantastical in their treatment.
It is unintelligible to us how
this picture illustrates the passage
quoted. Nos. 264-5 are Mr H. Barraud's
pictures:&mdash;<em>Lord have mercy
upon us</em>, and <em>We praise thee, O God!</em>
the engravings of which have for
some time past been in every shop-window.
We are really at a loss to
comprehend the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">engouement</i> for these
pictures, which seem to us as deficient
in real sentiment as they are feeble in
execution. They are pretty enough,
certainly, but that is all the praise we
are disposed to accord them. There
is no great beauty in the faces; and
one of the boys (on the spectator's
right hand) is a mere lout, without
any expression whatever. The Messrs
Barraud have a great many pictures
in this exhibition&mdash;amongst others,
No. 199, <em>The Curfew</em>, their joint production,
which is pretty, but in respect
to which it strikes us that they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
read Gray's poem wrong, for the
light in their picture is not that of
parting day, but of approaching sunset.
Mr Rayner's <em>Beauchamp Chapel,
Warwick</em>, is a good picture; Mr Niemann's
<em>Kenilworth from the Tilt-yard</em>,
and <em>Landscape</em>, No. 72, also deserve
praise; Mr Dighton is very effective
in some of his landscapes and studies.
Upon the whole, this young exhibition
promises well.</p>

<p>Driven to our utmost limits, we
must conclude, without further mention
than we have already here and
there made of the Society of British
Artists in Suffolk Street; and we do
so with the less regret because that
gallery contains but a small proportion
of pictures of merit. Mr Anthony
contributes a very large number of his
odd paintings, some of which are
rather effective at a distance; but it is
not a style we admire. Finally, we
have with pleasure noticed, during
our many rambles through the
different galleries, that the public not
only visit but buy; and we trust that
the year 1850 will prove profitable
and satisfactory to British artists, in
the same proportion that it undoubtedly
is creditable to their industry,
and, upon the whole, highly
honourable to their talents. One
word more we will say at parting.
In this article we have written down
opinions, formed neither hastily nor
partially, of whose soundness, although
critics will always differ, we venture
to feel pretty confident. We have
applied ourselves to point out merits
rather than defects, and to distribute
praise in preference to blame; but
we should have failed in our duty
to ourselves and the public, had
we altogether abstained from the
latter. We well know, however, the
many difficulties and discouragements
that beset the path of the painter.
And it would be matter for sincere
regret to us, if, in the freedom of our
remarks, we had unwittingly hurt the
feelings of any man who is honestly
and earnestly striving in the pursuit
of a very difficult art&mdash;although his
success may as yet be incommensurate
with his industry and zeal.</p>

<h2>LONDON AND EDINBURGH CHESS MATCH.</h2>


<p>If we pique ourselves on anything,
it is on our invincible good-nature.
We are as slow to be roused as a
brown bear in the midst of its winter
sleep; and, if we were let alone, we
very much doubt whether, by any
conceivable exertion, we could work
ourselves into a downright passion.
But, somehow or other, it constantly
happens that people of a less tranquil
mood step in to deprive us of the
enjoyment of our untroubled repose.
At one time some worthy fellow
entreats us to take up the public
cudgel and belabour a blatant Economist.
At another, we are pathetically
besought to administer due castigation
to some literary sinner who has
transgressed the first principles of
decency, morality, and taste. One
friend implores us, with tears in his
eyes, to take up the case of the
oppressed and injured washerwomen:
a second puts a tomahawk into our
hand, and benevolently suggests the
severment of the skull of a charlatan:
a third writes to us regarding a rowing
match, in which he opines gross
injustice has been done by the umpire
to the Buffs, and he fervently prays
for our powerful assistance in vindicating
the honour of the Blues.</p>

<p>In all national questions, it seems
to be expected that we are to act
with the devotion of a knight-errant.
Whenever Scotland is assailed, the
general impression is that we are
bound to stand forth, and incontinently
give battle to the enemy: and
we believe it will be admitted that
we have done so before now with no
inconsiderable effect. It so happens
that, at the present juncture, several
of our most esteemed compatriots,
feeling themselves deeply aggrieved
by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outrecuidance</i> of the Southron,
have laid the story of their wrongs before
us; and, after a deliberate review
of the whole circumstances of the case,
we feel ourselves compelled to come
forward in behalf of our countrymen.
Let no man venture to say that Chess
is an ignoble subject. It is, if properly
considered, as recondite a science
as mathematics. Kings, conquerors,
and sages have not thought it beneath
them to ponder over the chequered
board; and it may be that the
noble game has contributed in no light
degree to the success of their most
triumphant efforts. We know of no
absorption more complete than that
which possesses the mind of a true
votary of chess. Watch him as he is
contemplating his moves, and his
countenance is a perfect study for the
physiognomist. He may not perhaps
be the most agreeable of companions,
but we cannot expect loquacity from
men of high intellect whilst engaged
in deepest rumination.</p>

<p>Let us, however, dispense as much
as possible with preface, and come to
the actual offence which has induced
us to take up our pen in vindication
of the national honour. Our attention
has been called to what is undoubtedly
a departure from the fair and liberal
spirit which ought to actuate antagonists&mdash;in
short, by an attempt to
deprive the Edinburgh Chess Club
of laurels which were fairly and honourably
won. It is all very well
for men who have been beaten to
apply salves to their wounded vanity,
and to persuade themselves that
they have failed rather through misfortune
than from any deficiency of
skill. Napoleon used to amuse himself
at St Helena by demonstrating that
he <em>ought</em> to have won the battle
of Waterloo&mdash;a position in which,
we doubt not, Count Montholon and
General Bertrand entirely concurred,
though, after a certain time, they
must have been tolerably sick of the
subject. But these affirmations of
the Emperor did not serve the purpose
of reinstating him on the throne
of France; and, in like manner,
opine that the writers who, at this
time of day, are, applying themselves
to the task of persuading the public
that the great match at chess between
Edinburgh and London, which was
won by Edinburgh in 1828, ought to
have terminated otherwise, are losing
their labour, and, moreover, placing
themselves in a very ridiculous position.</p>

<p>We like to see a man take a beating
in good part. The Southron may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
come here and vanquish us at cricket,
and we shall submit to be bowled or
caught out with the utmost equanimity&mdash;no
member of the Grange Club
will retire to the cloister in consequence.
He may extinguish our renown at
rackets, or even soar considerably
above our mark in the altitude of the
flying-leap. We shall not cavil at
the result, should some Southron
Robin Hood defeat the Queen's Body
Guard in the toxophilite competition
which is about to take place in this
city. We shall not be jealous if the
stranger beats us; and if, in return, we
should extinguish him utterly at golf
or throwing the hammer, we promise
to crow as mildly as the plenitude of
our lungs will permit. But we have no
idea of pushing complaisance to such
an extraordinary point, as to permit
our real victories to be perverted and
annulled at the hands of a defeated
adversary. Hector <em>might</em> have beaten
Achilles, but he did not; and the
mere fact of a remote possibility having
once existed, will not justify us in
giving the lie to Homer. We make
every allowance for testiness; still we
cannot help thinking it extraordinary
that those feelings of mortification,
which might perhaps have been
excusable in the defeated party
at the moment of the antagonist's
triumph, should manifest themselves
as strongly as ever nearly a quarter
of a century after the contest&mdash;and
that, too, in persons who took no
actual share in it, and are comparatively
strangers to the views and opinions
of those really concerned.</p>

<p>English chess-players have the command
of all the chess-periodicals, which
emanate chiefly, if not exclusively, from
the London press; and which have,
for many years back, been made the
vehicles of repeated observations intended
to depreciate the triumph of
Scotland. Of late these have been
even more than usually frequent.
And within the last year, the <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite>, which, like the trunk of
an elephant, is as ready to pick up a
pin as to uproot a tree, has opened
its pages for remarks on the chess
match, conceived in no very handsome
spirit towards the Scotch champions.
This we do not consider to be
justifiable conduct on the part of our
bulky contemporary. In the accomplished
editor&mdash;himself a Scot&mdash;it is
in direct antagonism to the principles
of Richie, the servitor of Nigel, who
made so vigorous a stand for the credit
of the Water of Leith; and we regret
to observe so palpable a falling off from
the fervid patriotism of the Moniplies.
The uniform burden of the song is,
that the event of the match was determined
by an accident,&mdash;or by what
they reckon as nearly equivalent to
an accident&mdash;an oversight upon the
part of the London Club, to which
the best of players are liable, and
which in this instance is said to have
been rather ungenerously taken advantage
of by Edinburgh. The Scottish
players have hitherto said very
little upon the subject, contenting
themselves with a short but perfectly
satisfactory answer, made immediately
after the termination of the
match, to some observations of Mr
Lewis, in which, while they conclusively
disposed of his views and inferences,
they at the same time stated,
that they were "far from begrudging
to the London Club the usual consolation
of a beaten adversary&mdash;of going
back upon a game, and showing that,
if they had played otherwise at a
particular point, they could have won
the game." The constant reiteration
of the English statement, however, is
calculated to produce an erroneous
impression in the minds of those not
acquainted with the merits of the
question.</p>

<p>The London and Edinburgh chess
match, which was played by correspondence,
was begun in the year 1824.
It was the result of a challenge given
by the Edinburgh Club, which was
then only in its infancy. The terms
agreed on were, that the match should
consist of three won games; and that,
in case of any game being drawn, a
new one, begun by the same opener,
should take its place. The match
commenced on 23d April 1824. Two
games were opened simultaneously.
The first game was opened by the
Edinburgh Club; and in sending
their first answering move, the London
Club also sent the first move of
the second game. The first game,
which consisted of 35 moves, was, on
14th December 1824, declared to be
drawn. The second, which consisted
of 52 moves, was resigned by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
London Club on 23d February 1825.
The third game&mdash;opened by the Edinburgh
Club in place of the first game,
which had been drawn&mdash;was begun
on 20th December 1824; it consisted
of 99 moves, and was drawn on 18th
March 1828. The fourth game,
begun by the Edinburgh Club, on
26th February 1825, was resigned by
them on 15th September 1826, at the
55th move. The fifth game, begun
by the Edinburgh Club, on 6th October
1826, was resigned by the London
Club on 31st July 1828, at the 60th
move&mdash;and this determined the match
in favour of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The simple statement of these details
is sufficient altogether to exclude
the idea that the result of the match
was a mere accident, where manifestly
inferior players profited by the unfortunate
blunder of their superior
antagonists. Though the Edinburgh
Club had lost, instead of gaining, two
out of the three games, it would still
have been in vain to maintain that
the play in the match showed them
to be unquestionably inferior. The
contest was a long and severe one.
When the fifth and deciding game
was proceeding, each party had gained
one game, and there had been two
drawn games, both of which were
keenly disputed, without the least
advantage in favour of London at any
point of either; while, on the other
hand, in the third game, Edinburgh
had obtained an advantage, though
not sufficient to enable them to checkmate
their adversaries. It has never
been pretended, by the most unscrupulous
partisan of England, that
the winning of the fifth game was
ascribable to an oversight. On the
contrary, their chess writers have,
with most becoming fairness and
candour, always referred to it as an
instance of admirable play on the
part of Edinburgh; and members of
the London committee, who shortly
after happened to visit Edinburgh,
acknowledged that their committee
were quite unable to discover the
object of particular moves, the effect
of which had been previously calculated,
and reduced to demonstration
by the Edinburgh players. Is there,
in all this, such evidence of overwhelming
superiority on the part of the
English players, that their losing the
match <em>must</em> have been an accident?</p>

<p>But it is time to inquire a little
more minutely into the so-called
blunder, which the Englishmen say
was the cause of their defeat. And
here it is but fair to give their statement
in their own words. The
<cite>Quarterly</cite> reviewer says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Perhaps the most remarkable instance
on record of a strict enforcement of the
tenor of chess law occurred in the celebrated
match, by correspondence, between
the London and Edinburgh Clubs. At
the 27th move of the second game, the
London Club threw a rook away. How
they did so, Mr Lewis explains in the
following words:&mdash;'The 26th, 27th, and
28th moves were sent on the same day to
the Edinburgh Club. This was done to
save time. It so happened that the secretary,
whose duty it was to write the
letters, had an engagement which compelled
him to leave the Club two hours
earlier than usual&mdash;the letter was therefore
posted at three instead of five o'clock.
In the mean time, one of the members
discovered that the 2d move (the 27th)
had not been sufficiently examined.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> An
application was immediately made at the
Post-office for the letter, which was
refused. In consequence, a second letter
was transmitted by the same post to the
Edinburgh Club, retracting the 2d and
3d moves, and abiding only by the first.
The Edinburgh Club, in answer, gave it
as their decided opinion that the London
Club were bound by their letter, and that
no move could be retracted: they therefore
insisted on the moves being played.
The London Club conceded the point,
though they differed in opinion.'</p>

<p>"We cannot but think, under all the
circumstances, the Edinburgh Club were
to blame. What rendered the mishap
more vexatious to the Londoners was,
that whereas they had a won game before,
they now barely lost it, and thereby the
match, which the winning of this game
would have decided in their favour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
There can be little doubt that the London
Club (then comprising Messrs Lewis,
Fraser, and Cochrane) was the strongest
of the two. On the part of Edinburgh,
we believe the lion's share of the work
fell to the late Mr Donaldson."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the remarks on the London and
Amsterdam match, in Mr Staunton's
periodical, (the <cite>Chess-Player's Chronicle</cite>,)
for February 1850, there is the
following passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If the relative skill of the competitors
engaged on each side were to be the
gauge by which to estimate the probable
result of a contest like this, it would have
been easy to predict to which party victory
would incline; and we should have
wondered at the daring gallantry that
prompted the little band of Hollanders to
challenge the leviathans of London. Experience,
however, has shown that, in a
match of chess by correspondence, the
battle is not always to the strong, and
that foresight and profound calculation
are of infinitely less account, when the
men may be moved experimentally, than
they are in ordinary chess, where conclusions
must be tried by the head, and not
by the hand. Of this, indeed, the archives
of the London Club afford a memorable
instance. In March 1824, a proposal was
made to this Club by the Club at Edinburgh,
to play a match at chess by correspondence
for a silver cup; the match
to consist of three games, (irrespective of
drawn games;) two games to be played
together, and the winner of the first game
to have the move in the third. The London
Club at this period was in the pride
and plenitude of its strength, and the
committee appointed to conduct the match
comprised every name of note among the
chess-players of the metropolis. The
Edinburgh Chess-Club, on the other hand,
was composed of amateurs comparatively
unknown and inexperienced, and possessed
one player only&mdash;the late Mr Donaldson&mdash;capable
of making anything like a
stand 'over the board' with any of the
London chiefs. In an ordinary contest,
indeed, over the board, it was the old
odds of Lombard Street to a China orange!
Maugre all the advantages of superior
skill and practice, however, the Londoners
lost the battle, and lost it by a blunder
as ridiculous as it was vexatious, at
the very moment, too, when the game was
in their hands."</p></blockquote>

<p>The general remarks on playing by
correspondence in this last passage
are evidently made to furnish a pretence
for introducing the notice of the
London and Edinburgh match; and
they share the fate of all such forced
work. They are absolute nonsense.
The probability that a decidedly superior
will overcome an inferior player,
is not at all diminished by the circumstance
that the match is played by
correspondence. On the contrary,
we should rather be inclined to say
that the chance of an inferior player's
escape in a single game or so is almost
extinguished where the match is played
by correspondence; because the
time given for deliberation increases
the improbability of his antagonist's
erring from carelessness, or not taking
in the whole position of the game,
which sometimes occurs in playing
over the board. But there is an inconsequence
in the whole argument
which surprises us to find in anything
sanctioned by a person of Mr Staunton's
unquestionable powers of mind.
The loss of the match by London is
not to be wondered at, it is said, because
it was a match by correspondence;
and the immediate cause of
their losing it was the commission of
a ridiculous and vexatious blunder!
To make this anything like logic, it
would be necessary to hold that ridiculous
and vexatious blunders are
more likely to be committed when the
player has time and opportunity to
consider his moves, and to make experiments
upon their effect, than where
he is under the necessity of moving at
once in presence of an adversary, and
possibly of spectators, apt to get impatient
at long delay. It is plain that
the game's being played by correspondence
was the very circumstance calculated
to render the London Club's
particular excuse for losing all the
more untenable.</p>

<p>It is quite true, however, that at a
particular stage of the game opened
by the London Club, (being one of the
two games with which the match commenced,)
the London Club might have
won the game, by playing other moves
than they did. This may be said of
every game; but it is as unusual as
it is unhandsome for the unsuccessful
party, merely because he has missed
such an opportunity of winning, to
refuse all credit to his adversary for
afterwards defeating him. In the
third game, which was drawn, the
Edinburgh Club would have won if
they had played a different 51st move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
from that which they did. But this
did not lead them to make depreciatory
remarks about their antagonists:
all that their report bears on this point
is, that the London Club "conducted
a difficult defence with great skill and
dexterity, and finally succeeded in
drawing the game."</p>

<p>Further, the remarks above quoted
are calculated to produce an erroneous
idea respecting the situation and conduct
of the two clubs in the second
game. The sophistry consists in
mixing up two entirely separate and
unconnected things. In this same
game in which the London Club failed
to observe that they had a winning
position, they applied to have two of
their moves recalled after they were
despatched, and the Edinburgh committee
refused their request. Now
the obvious tendency of all that the
English writers say upon the subject
is to create the impression that if the
London Club had been allowed to
recall these two moves, they would
have retained their winning position.
This is plainly the only construction
that the passage in the <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite> is capable of bearing. It is
the only construction which would
justify his remarks, or make them at
all intelligible. But it is quite incorrect.
The only moves which the
London committee wished to recall
were the 27th and 28th; but they
have never attempted to show that if
they had been allowed to do so, they
could have won the game. It has
been demonstrated, over and over
again, that they could not. In fact,
the moves they wished to recall were
as good as any others then in their
power. They might have drawn
the game if these moves had been
played; and they could have done no
more had they been allowed to recall
them. This matter was set at rest
while the match was still pending, by
a proposal which emanated from the
Edinburgh Club. When the Londoners
lost the game, Mr Lewis insinuated,
though he did not expressly
state, that if they had not been
held to the 27th and 28th moves,
they would have won the game.
A member of the Edinburgh Club then
offered to play a back-game with any
one or more of the London Club, in
which the London players were to be
allowed a new 27th move instead of
the one they had made, and wished
to recall; and also another back-game
in which the Edinburgh player was to
take the London side <em>at an earlier stage
of the game</em>, with the view of showing
that, by playing differently, the London
Club might have won it. This proposal
was under consideration of the
London Club <em>for several weeks</em>, during
which they satisfied themselves that
the recall of the 27th and 28th moves
would be of no use, and, accordingly,
it was declined. It is surely not
very uncharitable to surmise that
it was during this period, and on the
suggestion of their opponents, that
they discovered that the error was not
in the 27th move which they had proposed
to recall, but in the 26th, which
they had examined and adhered to.
In his first publication of the games,
Mr Lewis gives no back-game on this
26th move; and it is believed that no
member of the London Club was
aware, till the game was finished, that
by playing differently at the 26th move
they might have won it. But Mr
Lewis admits that the game could not
be won by a mere alteration of the
27th or 28th move; and any one who
says that it could, is either speaking
in ignorance of the subject, or is
making a wilful misrepresentation.
The likelihood of the remarks of the
English writers producing an erroneous
impression arises from their
mixing up these two separate and
distinct things: 1st, that at a previous
stage of the game, the London Club
had a winning position which they
did not discover, and failed to avail
themselves of; and, 2d, that the
Edinburgh Club would not allow them
to retract the 27th and 28th moves.
These two facts have no longer any
possible connection with each other
when it is known that, at the 27th
move, the London Club had ceased to
have a winning position, and that the
recall of that move would have been
of no use to them. The failure, at a
previous stage of the game, to maintain
the winning position which they
had, is simply one among several
illustrations which occurred in the
match, of the truth that the London
Club, "in the pride and plenitude of
its strength," did not always play as
well as it was possible to have done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
How such things show that superiority
on the part of London, which they are
brought forward to establish, we confess
ourselves unable to understand,
unless we were to adopt the principle
of the <cite>Chess-Players' Chronicle</cite>, that
it is the best players who are most
likely to commit errors in conducting
a match by correspondence!!</p>

<p>It seems to be a source of melancholy
consolation to the English
players, that their Club committed a
"ridiculous and vexatious blunder."
We are sorry that, in our strict regard
for truth, we must deprive them even
of that comfort. The losing of the
disputed game was not a ridiculous
blunder, however vexatious. On the
contrary, the series of moves by which
they lost the chance of winning, was
at first a very promising attack, and
had the additional temptation of
appearing brilliant and enterprising.
If any chess-player will set up the
men at the 27th move of the London
Club, or glance at the diagram given
in Mr Staunton's periodical for May
1850, he will see that nothing but the
utmost skill and caution on the part
of Edinburgh could have successfully
warded off the attack. The London
Club had not contemplated the defence
which they met with; and if, in
these circumstances, they were seduced
into an ingenious but unsound attack,
it may be conceded that they manifested
want of circumspection, an
important qualification in a chess-player;
but they cannot be accused
of committing a ridiculous blunder.
They talk of having "thrown away"
a rook. They did no such thing.
The rook was played not by mistake,
but for the very purpose of being
taken in the course of their dashing
but unsuccessful attack. And in Mr
Lewis's analyses, it will be found
that many of his methods of winning,
at previous stages of the game,
involve this very sacrifice of the
rook.</p>

<p>The refusal of the Edinburgh Club
to allow the recall of the 27th and
28th moves loses all its importance
when it is known that it did not affect
the fate of the game. But we should
in any circumstances be sorry to
believe that, in so refusing, they
had done what deserved the censure
bestowed on them by the
<cite>Quarterly</cite> reviewer. In considering
the propriety of their conduct, there
are only two lights in which the
request may be viewed. They were
either asked to do what the London
Club had a right to demand, or they
were asked to grant a favour to the
London Club. We do not know that
the former view is supported by any
of the English writers. Even the
<cite>Quarterly</cite> reviewer does not say that
the London Club had a <em>right</em> to recall
the moves; and on this question of
right it appears to us that there cannot
be the least shadow of a doubt.
The letter containing the moves was
despatched to the Post-office. It
was held by the Post-office for the
party to whom it was addressed, and
was entirely beyond the control of
the party sending it. The piece, in
every sense, was therefore "let go"
by the player; and the 8th Article of
Sarratt's laws of chess, by which it
was agreed that the games should be
played, provides that "as long as a
player holds a piece, he is at liberty
to play it where he chooses; but
when he has <em>let it go</em>, he cannot
recall his move." Accordingly, the
London Club never attempted to
contest the question of right. They
stated that they had "no hesitation
in acceding to the Edinburgh Committee's
construction," and adhering
to the moves. In fact, the construction
put on the point by the Edinburgh
Club was not only assented to by
the London players at the time, but
several members of the committee
admitted afterwards, that it was
unquestionably the right way of
dealing with the case, and no member
of the London Club ever hinted a
complaint on the subject, except
what was insinuated by Mr Lewis
in the publication referred to.</p>

<p>Were the Edinburgh Club "<em>to blame</em>"
for not granting the favour which was
asked of them? On this question
we think there is quite as little doubt
as the other. We have a strong and
decided opinion as to the necessity
of strict play in <em>all</em> games. It is the
only fair and rational system; for
once allow indulgence, and it is
impossible to fix the limit at which it
should stop. But we think that the
remark applies with peculiar force to
the game of chess, in which rigour is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
absolutely essential to the acquisition
of the habits fitted for the proper
playing of the game. Above all, in
an important match at chess, anything
but the strict game is entirely
out of the question. A high-spirited
antagonist will scorn to ask a favour,
or even to grumble about the commission
of a blunder. He submits in
silence, and plays on in the hope of
retrieving his fault by redoubled care
and attention. If, on the other hand,
he were to be expected to grant
favours to his blundering antagonist,
it is plain that his very good qualities
would be turned to his disadvantage
in the match. The Edinburgh Club
played in the belief that the rules of
the game were to apply with equal
strictness to both parties; and though
there was more than one instance in
which they would have been glad to
recall a move, they never proposed
this, or even spoke of the occasions for
it, except in answer to Mr Lewis's
observations on the proposed recall of
the 27th move. In the very game in
which this move was made, the Edinburgh
committee had at a <em>previous</em>
point in the game made a move which
they discovered to be unsound, or at
least doubtful. Their report bears
that "application was made to the
Post-office to have the letter containing
it restored, but without effect.
Finding this to be the case, the letter
was looked upon as delivered, the
Post-office being regarded as holding
it, not on behalf of the Club from
which it had been sent, but on behalf
of the Club to which it was addressed;
and therefore no attempt was made to
countermand the move, by transmitting
another letter by the same post.
The 8th article of the laws was considered
to be too clear and explicit to
warrant a recall." This conduct of
the Edinburgh Club appears to us the
manly and proper way of dealing
with such a circumstance, and infinitely
better than trying to make it
the foundation of a complaint of rigorous
procedure on the part of their
opponents.</p>

<p>The same thing happened again to
the Edinburgh Club in the fourth
game. In consequence of having put
up the game erroneously, they sent
an impossible move&mdash;that is to
say, they directed a Knight to be
moved to a square already occupied
by their King. They discovered the
mistake before the letter had left
Edinburgh, but considered themselves
as having incurred the penalty of
playing an impossible move, which
was, in the option of their adversary,
either to move the Knight to some
other square, or to move their King.
Of these two, the move of the <em>King</em>
was infinitely the better play, and
therefore, in order to save time, a
note was written on the outside of
the letter explaining the mistake, and
stating that the Edinburgh committee
held themselves bound to move
the <em>Knight</em>, which it was presumed
the London Club would enforce, as
the more severe penalty. The London
Club did so; and yet Mr Lewis,
in his notes to this game, rather
disingenuously, as it appears to us,
represented the London Club as
having yielded an advantage to their
antagonists, in accepting the move of
the Knight. This merely accidental
blunder, on the part of the Edinburgh
Club, was one cause of their loss of
the fourth game.</p>

<p>Seeing that the Edinburgh Club
thus on all occasions subjected themselves
to the most rigorous interpretation
of the rules of the game, we cannot
hold the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> as
justified in saying that they were "to
blame" in not allowing the London
Club to retract a move. But we
appeal from the <cite>Quarterly</cite> reviewer as
a partisan of England, to the <cite>Quarterly</cite>
reviewer, as an impartial enunciator
of general propositions respecting the
game of chess. Hear what he says
about the absurdity of giving back
moves:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Another advantage has arisen from
the multiplication of clubs, and consequent
publication of accurate rules&mdash;viz.,
that the strict game is now played, instead
of those courteous surrenders of
advantages offered by a heedless adversary,
which used often to make winners
of those who had received back two or
three leading pieces in the course of the
game. These were a source of endless
unpleasant discussions, besides being in
themselves an absurdity. We confess
we have no notion of rewarding an opponent
for his oversights. We would show
him as little mercy as Mr Smith O'Brien
would to Lord Clarendon. Nay, we
should be moved hereto by a consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of his benefit as well as our own&mdash;for
why should we teach him vacillation
and heedlessness?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, among a portentous list of
narrow-minded delusions, he gives as
"Delusion the Fifth&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'That it is illiberal to play the strict
game.' To this we can only reply, that
other methods are but a miserable imitation.
People talk of the hardship of
'losing a game by an oversight,' and so
on. It is much harder to arrive at nothing
but 'conclusions inconclusive,' and
to have the game terminate in an Irish
discussion which of the two parties made
the greatest blunders."</p></blockquote>

<p>We agree in every word of this;
and we only wonder that so sound a
reasoner should himself fall under the
delusion which he exposes&mdash;so severe
a censor should commit the very
offence which he condemns.</p>

<p>On the whole, as regards the proposed
recall of the 27th and 28th
moves of the second game, we think
these three propositions are conclusively
established, 1. That neither
according to the rules of the game,
nor upon any other principle which
does or ought to regulate the playing
of matches, were the London Club
entitled to have their proposal acceded
to. 2. That though it had been acceded
to, and these moves had been allowed
to be recalled, the London Club
could not have bettered their situation,
as the opportunity of winning
was already irretrievably lost in consequence
of the 26th move, which was
not asked to be recalled, but, on the
contrary, was expressly adhered to.
3. That the impression which English
chess-players have so industriously
attempted to create, that the
refusal on the part of Edinburgh to
allow the 27th and 28th moves to be
recalled was what prevented the London
Club from winning the game, can
only exist through a confusion between
these moves and the previous one,
which the London Club had adhered
to after a renewed examination, not
having even then discovered that it
was unsound.</p>

<p>Before leaving the second game, we
have this last additional remark to
make about it, that it is one of the erroneous
assumptions and inferences of
the English writers, that the winning
of that game would have decided the
match in their favour. It was the
first won game; and though it is true
that the London Club <em>subsequently</em> won
the fourth game, which was the successor
of the second, it is also the fact
that the fourth game, which was
opened by the Edinburgh Club, would
not have been played if the second had
been won by London, who in that case
would have had the opening of the
fourth. We do not mean to say that
having to open was a disadvantage.
All we assert is, that, in point of fact,
the game, which the Edinburgh Club
lost partly through a mistake in setting
up the men, and through another blunder,
not very different in its character,
would not have been played at all if
London had won the second game.
Besides, the fourth game would, in
other respects, have been played under
very different circumstances. The
opening of the second game by the
London Club was one which none of
the Edinburgh players had ever seen
before, though, from this match, it
now goes by the name of the Scotch
opening. They believed, however,
from their consideration of the second
game, that the London Club had not
availed themselves of all the capabilities
of the opening, and they thought
it would be a spirited thing to return
it upon their antagonists. This they
did in the <em>third</em> game. The event rewarded
their enterprising conduct.
They gained a decided advantage;
and during the greater part of the
<em>fourth</em> game they believed that it
would never require to be finished, as
they thought that by winning the <em>third</em>
game they would gain the match.
This accounts for the carelessness with
which they played the fourth game,
though we think nothing can excuse
carelessness in playing chess. They
were ultimately disappointed in their
expectation of gaining the third game,
as the London Club succeeded in drawing
it; and this rendered a fifth game
necessary.</p>

<p>Down to the fifth game it appears
plain enough, from the above examination,
that the Edinburgh Club had
maintained, at the very least, an
equal position to their antagonists.
The first game had been drawn, with
no advantage at any stage of it, in
favour of either party. The second
had been won by Edinburgh, but was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
subject to the observation that, at one
point, London might have won had
they played as well as they <em>afterwards</em>
discovered they might have done. The
third game was drawn: but the advantage
throughout had been in favour
of Edinburgh, though not sufficiently
so for winning; and, as was the case
with London in the previous game,
Edinburgh failed to perceive that by
moving differently at a certain point,
they would have been victorious. The
fourth game was lost by Edinburgh,
partly through an accidental and
what may be called a mechanical blunder,
and partly through another piece
of carelessness of a similar character.
After a contest thus maintained down
to the commencement of the fifth
game, it is beyond all question that
the palm of superiority, in point of
play, must rest with the victor in that
game. And it was a game worthy to
determine that question as well as the
match. The Edinburgh Club had
again returned upon their antagonists
their own opening. In order to secure
scope for the action of their pieces,
they showed considerable intrepidity
in disregarding the ordinary rules
against doubled and isolated pawns;
and so admirably had they analysed
the game, that for a great many
moves they knew that victory was
certain, though all the while the
London Club, according to the confession
of some of their own members,
were blind to the fate that was awaiting
them; and believed, on the contrary,
that the game was in their own hands.
This fifth game will long be remembered
by chess players as one of the
most remarkable in the annals of
chess; and appears to us conclusive,
so far as regards the internal evidence
derived from the games themselves,
that the superiority, in point of play,
lay with the Edinburgh Club, and
that their winning the match was not
a mere accident.</p>

<p>It may be that there are other data
for determining the relative superiority
of the two Clubs; but we cannot admit
the correctness of any of those mentioned
by the <cite>Quarterly</cite> reviewer or
Mr Staunton. It is true, as these gentlemen
say, that the Edinburgh Club
was comparatively inexperienced.
It had only been instituted in 1822,
and the match was begun in 1824.
It comprehended, almost exclusively,
professional gentlemen actively engaged
in business, who had not,
generally speaking, much leisure or
opportunity for seeking antagonists
out of their own little circle of chess-players
at home. On the other hand,
it cannot be disputed that there is to
be found in the metropolis of England,
in greater abundance than anywhere
else, that combination of leisure with
intellectual power, which gives the
promise of good chess-playing. But
these circumstances do not lead our
minds to the conclusion to which Mr
Staunton and the <cite>Quarterly</cite> reviewer
have come, that the winning of the
match by the Edinburgh Club was an
accident. We should rather be inclined
to hold, considering the character of the
contest as explained by us above,
that they are a proof of the greater
natural chess-playing capacity of the
members of the Club which won the
match under such disadvantages.
Again, Mr Staunton asks where are
the previous exploits to which the
Edinburgh players could point, such
as those that the members of the
London Club had performed? The
answer is, None. They never had, and
never sought the opportunity of
performing any great chess exploit,
except beating the London Club.
But in so doing they made their own
all the previous victories of the
London Club. The event showed
that they might, without presumption,
have expressed the sentiment of
Prince Henry&mdash;</p>

<h2>THE INDUSTRY OF THE PEOPLE.</h2>


<p>The dismal efforts of the Free-trading
party to maintain the credit
of their unnatural and mischievous
scheme, afford the surest indication
of their own consciousness that they
have committed a grievous error. In
their attempts to make head against
the symptoms of reaction which are
everywhere apparent in the public
mind, they exhibit no unity of purpose;
they are not agreed even as to
the facts from which their arguments
should be drawn. A few months ago,
we were told that the whole country
was in a state of the greatest prosperity.
The existence of agricultural
distress was denied; the shipping
interest was said to be in the
most healthy and flourishing condition;
the manufacturers had so many
orders that their ability to execute
was impeded; wages were rising&mdash;pauperism
decreasing&mdash;in short, no
one could recall to memory times of
more general happiness and content.
Such was the picture drawn by Ministerial
limners, no further back than
the opening of the present session of
Parliament, and it is very much to be
regretted that it should so soon have
vanished like a dissolving view.
Down to the present moment, we
have been unable to discover the
motive for so monstrous a fiction.
Nobody believed it: nobody could
believe it, for it ran counter to every
man's knowledge of his own affairs,
and his opinion as to those of his
neighbour. The agriculturists declared
it to be a falsehood in so far as
they were concerned&mdash;so did the ship-owners&mdash;so
did the shopkeepers&mdash;so
did the manufacturers, whose circulars
acknowledged depression for the
present, and held out little hope for
the future. The Ministerial averment
answered no purpose, save to excite
a general burst of disapprobation.
Conceived in fraud, it was abandoned
with cowardice. A lower tone was
assumed. Distress was admitted&mdash;but
only to a certain extent; and we
may remark that such admissions are
peculiarly convenient and innocuous
to those who make them, inasmuch
as the actual degree or prevalence of
the suffering must still remain matter
of debate. Indeed, no statistics, however
ingenious or elaborated, can furnish
data for determining so delicate
a point. But to account for the
existence of distress, even in a mitigated
form, was no easy task for
those who were resolved, at all
hazards, to exclude the operation of
free trade. Their prosperity balance-sheet
stood awkwardly in the way.
Pluming themselves upon increased
exports, and a larger foreign trade
than had been driven for some years,
they were compelled to assign some
reason for the remarkable depression
at home. The old shift of railway calls
would no longer suit their purpose.
Sir Robert Peel, regardless of a certain
personal passage of his life connected
with the opening of the Trent Valley,
was exceedingly fond of turning out
that scape-goat into the wilderness;
but the time had gone by; the calls
were paid up or suspended; and it
was no longer possible for effrontery
to maintain that the great mass of
the consumers of these kingdoms had
been materially injured by their
imprudent dalliance with scrip. There
was no tightness in the money
market; no external cause to interfere
with the successful operation of
industry, capital, or enterprise. Yet
still there was distress; and, what was
more remarkable, the complaint was
universal. The value of produce had
fallen, effecting thereby a corresponding
decline in rents, and every kind
of uncertain profit. Employment
grew scarcer every day, whilst the
number of applicants increased. The
burden of taxation, however, still
remained undiminished. The creditor
could still exact the stipulated amount
of money from his debtor, without
deduction, although the labour of the
debtor was reduced in point of value
by at least a third. Such were, and
are, the leading phenomena, to account
for which the ingenuity of the
Free-traders has been exercised.</p>

<p>They have, we are bound to say, cut
an exceedingly sorry figure in explanation.
They have got in their mouths a
few cant phrases, which, when assailed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
they repeat over and over again, without
the slightest reference to their
meaning. One of these, and perhaps
the most favourite, refers to the "transition
state"&mdash;a peculiar phase of suffering,
which they maintain to be the
necessary consequence of every considerable
change in the fiscal regulations
of the empire. This "transition state,"
in politics, would appear to correspond
to that which, in medicine, was favoured
by Mr St John Long. In
order to become better, it is necessary
to make the patient, in the first
instance, materially worse&mdash;to inflict
artificial wounds and promote
suppuration, in the hope that these
may afterwards be healed. It is
rather remarkable that none of our
political doctors have as yet ventured
to specify the nature of the curatory
process. They leave us woefully in
the dark as to the means which are
to be adopted for remedying the evil;
and they obstinately refuse to predict
what kind of state is to follow upon
this of transition. In truth, they are
utterly at sea. They cannot shut
their eyes to the extent of the mischief
which they have wrought; they
cannot find or invent an extraneous
excuse, which will avail them, in the
opinion even of the loosest thinker, to
maintain the delusion that the present
distress and stagnation are attributable
to any other cause than that of low
prices, occasioned by foreign competition;
and they are attempting to conceal
their chagrin and disappointment
at the disastrous issue of their experiment
under the cover of general
terms and vague ambiguous phrases&mdash;a
rhetorical expedient which is not
likely to have much weight with those
who have been made the victims of
their rashness or vacillation.</p>

<p>Latterly, indeed, some portions of
the public press have shown symptoms
of being more specific, and very
glad should we be if Ministers would
follow that example. We are told
that present prices are merely exceptional,
and that they must shortly
improve. The mere adoption of this
argument shows that such writers
dissent from the doctrine that cheapness
is an unqualified blessing&mdash;that
they still believe in their hearts that
it is impossible altogether to separate
the interests of the producer and the
consumer&mdash;and that they are still
alive to the fundamental political
axiom, that the wealth of a country
depends mainly upon the value of its
produce. Were it otherwise, they
would be supporters of the most
astounding paradox that was ever
advanced. The price of the loaf
must rise correspondingly with that
of the quarter of wheat: beef and
mutton are sold by the stone or by
the pound, in proportion to the market
value of the living animal. If
wheat were to rise to 56s., which is
said to be the average cost of its
production in this country, bread
would become so much dearer, and,
in that case, the working-man could
be no better off than he was before
the corn laws were repealed. We
have heard it said, and we firmly
believe it to be the case, that many
of the public men, of both parties,
who voted with Sir Robert Peel, did
so under the full conviction that there
could be no material decline&mdash;that
they were misled by the onesided,
imperfect, and fallacious reports as to
the state, quality, and extent of the
Continental harvests, which were laid
before Parliament&mdash;and that they
never would have consented to such a
measure, had they foreseen the results
which are now unhappily before us.
We gather this, not merely from
rumour, but from the tenor of the
speeches delivered in the House of
Commons in 1846. Sir James Graham
and Lord John Russell both treated as
visionary the notion of any material
decline&mdash;Lord Palmerston went
further; and we think it useful to lay
before our readers the following excerpt
from his speech, delivered on
the occasion of the second reading of
the Corn Importation Bill. Referring
to the surplus quantity of Continental
grain, he said&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The surplus quantity now, or from
time to time in existence, is merely the
superfluity of abundant seasons held for
a time in store to meet the alternate
deficiency of bad years. Till the bad
years come, that corn is cheap, because
it is a supply exceeding the demand; but
the moment we go into the foreign
market as buyers, to purchase up this
surplus, <em>prices abroad will rise</em>. Not
only will the British demand, as a new
competition with foreign demand, naturally
cause a rise of prices, but our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
merchants will compete against each
other, until, by a rise of prices abroad,
the profit of their importations shall have
been brought down to the usual rate of
mercantile profit upon capital employed
in other ways. There is, therefore, very
little probability that the importation of
the existing surplus quantity of corn in
foreign markets will materially lower
prices in this country."</p></blockquote>

<p>We have nothing to say to the
arguments of the noble Viscount&mdash;however
singular these may appear
to persons of ordinary understanding&mdash;we
merely refer to his conclusion,
which we think is plain enough, to
the effect that free importations could
not materially lower prices. Nay,
we could extract from the speeches of
Sir Robert Peel himself, passages
which would go far to show that he
entertained the same opinion, notwithstanding
the extreme wariness
which he exhibited when challenged
by Lord George Bentinck to state his
views as to the probable effects of the
change on the value of agricultural
produce. Well, then, if this be the
case&mdash;if there was actually a strong
conviction in the minds of the leading
men who supported the repeal of
the corn laws that the expressed
fears of the agricultural party were
unfounded&mdash;are we not entitled now
to require that the question should be
brought to a very narrow issue indeed?
So far as experience has gone,
our calculations have proved right&mdash;theirs
entirely wrong. We maintained
that, in consequence of the
removal of protective duties, the price
of grain in this country would decline
to a point far below the cost of production;
they averred that nothing
of the kind would happen. Nearly a
year and a half has elapsed since the
new system came into full operation,
and the general averages of wheat
throughout the country have fallen,
and have remained for many months
below 40s. per quarter. In spite of
the accurate and veracious information
of writers in the <cite>Economist</cite> and
other Ministerial prints, who have
been assuring us, for a long period of
time, that the whole available supplies
of grain have been pumped out
of the Continent, importations continue
undiminished. In May 1850
we receive from abroad the equivalent
of a million quarters of grain;
France pours in her flour, to the panic
even of our millers; and, instead of
diminution, there are unmistakeable
symptoms of a greater deluge than
before. Now, if the Free-traders, in
or out of Parliament, are honest in
their views&mdash;as many of them, we
believe, undoubtedly are&mdash;they are
bound to tell us how far and how long
they intend this experiment to last?
Of course, if it is no experiment at
all, but an absolute rigorous finality,
there is no need of entering into discussion.
If everything is to be sacrificed
for cheapness, let cheapness be
the rule; only do not let us behold the
anomaly of the advocates of that system
prophesying a rise of prices as a
general boon to the country. If
otherwise, surely some tangible period
should be assigned for the endurance
of this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum crucis</i>. We
entirely coincide with Lord John
Russell in his dislike to vacillating
legislation, and we have no wish
whatever to precipitate matters. We
think it preferable, in every way, that
the eyes of the country should be
opened to a sense of its true condition
by a process which, to be effectual,
cannot be otherwise than painful.
But we are greatly apprehensive of
the consequences which may arise
ere long, from the obstinate refusal of
Ministers to give the slightest indication
of their intentions, supposing
that the present prices shall continue;
or to indicate what relief, if any, can
be given to the industry of the nation.</p>

<p>As to the permanent nature of the
fall under the operation of the present
law, we entertain not the slightest
doubt. There is no one symptom
visible of its abatement; on the contrary,
the experience of each succeeding
month tends to fortify our previous
impressions. The decline in the
value of cattle is as great as in that of
cereal produce. We have already, in
a former paper, had occasion to state
the extent of that fall down to the
commencement of the present year:
the accounts received of the state
of the Dumbarton market, held in the
beginning of June, are still more disastrous
than before. Throughout a
large portion of the Scottish Highlands&mdash;we
do not know, indeed,
whether we are entitled to make any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
exception&mdash;black cattle, the staple
of the country, will not pay the expense
of rearing. The enormous importation
of provisions from America
is annihilating this branch of produce,
with what compensating benefit to
the nation at large, it would be difficult
for an economist to explain.</p>

<p>This is a state of matters which
cannot continue long without manifest
danger even to the tranquillity of the
country. It is quite plain that, at
present rates, agriculture cannot be
carried on as heretofore in Great
Britain. The farmer has been the
first sufferer; the turn of the landowner
is approaching. Let us illustrate
this shortly. There must be, on
an average of ordinary years, a certain
price at which wheat can be grown
remuneratively in this country. Sir
Robert Peel, no mean authority on
the subject, has indicated his opinion
that such price may be stated at or
about 56s. per quarter. Mr James
Wilson, rating it somewhat lower,
fixes it at 52s. 2d. Let us suppose,
that wheat for the future shall average
over England 39s. per quarter, and
that the produce of the acre is twenty-four
bushels, the loss on each acre of
wheat hereafter raised will be, according
to Sir Robert Peel, £2, 11s.&mdash;according
to Mr Wilson, £1, 19s. 6d.
What deduction of rent can meet
such a depreciation as this? Excluding
Middlesex, which is clearly exceptional,
the highest rented county
of England, Leicester, is estimated at
£1, 14s. 10d. per acre; Warwickshire,
at £1, 11s. 6d.; and Lincolnshire at
£1, 8s. Haddington and Fife, the
highest rented counties of Scotland,
are estimated at £1, 5s. 6d. per acre.
This of course includes much land of an
inferior description; but we believe
that, for the best arable land, an average
rent of 40s. per acre may be assumed.
In that case, supposing the whole rent
to be given up, the farmer would still
be a loser by cultivation, if Sir Robert
Peel is correct in his figures.</p>

<p>Without presuming to offer an
opinion as to the accuracy of either of
the calculations submitted by these
two Free-trading authorities, we think
it is plain that the more favourable of
them, taken in connection with present
prices, is appalling enough to the
agriculturist, whether he be landlord
or tenant. We shall see, probably in
a month or two, whether it is likely
that even these prices can be maintained.
We are clearly of opinion
that the price of corn in this country
must fall to the level of the cheapest
market from which we can derive any
considerable supplies; and in that
case it is quite as likely that we may
see wheat quoted at 32s. or 33s., as
at 39s. or 40s. But the matter for
our consideration is, that, ever since
the repeal of the corn laws, the market
price of grain has been greatly
below the cost of its production; and
that there are no symptoms of any
amendment, but obviously the reverse.</p>

<p>The inevitable result of the continuance
of such a state of matters is
too clear to admit of argument. The
land must go out of cultivation. The
process may be slow, but it will be
sure. It may, doubtless, be retarded
by remissions of rent not sufficient to
cover the farmer's losses, but great
enough to induce him to renew his
efforts for another year with the like
miserable result; until at length the
tiller of the soil is made bankrupt,
and the landowner occupies his place.
We can hardly trust ourselves to
depict the effect of such a social revolution.
All the misery which has
been already felt&mdash;and that is far
greater than our rulers will permit
themselves to believe&mdash;would be as
nothing compared with the calamitous
consummation of Free Trade.</p>

<p>Yet it is towards that point that
we are rapidly tending. Some of the
fierce and more plain-spoken Radical
journals are so far from contradicting
our views, that they openly rejoice in
the havoc which has been already
made, and in the wider ruin which is
impending. They say plainly, looking
to the funds, that they see no
method of escaping from the domination
of the moneyed interest, except
through the prostration of the landlords.
Their meaning is quite distinct
and undisguised. They want to get
rid of the national debt, by reducing
the value of produce so low, that the
usual amount of taxation cannot possibly
be levied; and their scheme, however
nefarious, is by no means devoid
of plausibility. There can be no doubt
that the Currency Act of 1819 has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
operated most injuriously upon the
industry of the nation, by enhancing
the value of the claims of the creditor;
and that these claims, along with the
necessary expenses of government,
must be paid, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante omnia</i>, from the
industrial produce of the year. The
cheapening process, therefore, is one
directly antagonistic to the maintenance
of taxation. The anomaly in
legislation of forcibly reducing the
value of produce, and yet maintaining
stringently an artificial standard of
taxation, has been reserved for our
times; yet, strange to say, though its
effects are visible and confessed, few
persons have courage or patience
enough to grapple with the difficulty.
Free Trade and a Fettered Currency
are things that cannot possibly co-exist
for any length of time; and our
sole surprise is, that any statesman
could be shortsighted enough to
attempt to reconcile them. Taken
singly, either of them is a great evil
to a country situated like ours&mdash;taken
together, they become absolutely intolerable.
But we have no wish, at
the present time, to depart from the
point before us. We are merely
taking the evidence of adversaries, to
show that our views as to the position
and prospects of the great productive
classes of Britain are so far from exaggerated
that they are acknowledged
by the most strenuous advocates of
Free Trade. The fundholder, nevertheless,
may derive a useful lesson
from these financial hints, which indicate
an ulterior purpose.</p>

<p>Such is the state of the agricultural
interest throughout the three Kingdoms
at this moment, and such are
the prospects before us. The evidence,
albeit not taken before a committee
of either House of Parliament, is too
unanimous to admit of a doubt;
county after county, district after
district, parish after parish throughout
England, have testified to their
melancholy condition. The <cite>Times</cite>
may talk of mendicity, and the <cite>Economist</cite>
may trump up figures to show
that the farmers ought to be making
a profit even at present prices; but
neither irony nor fiction can avail to
discredit or pervert facts so well
authenticated as these. Of these
facts parliament is fully cognisant&mdash;not
only from the individual knowledge
of members as to what is passing
abroad&mdash;not only from the sentiments
expressed at many hundred
meetings, independent of the great
demonstrations lately made at London
and Liverpool&mdash;but from the
petitions which have been presented
to both Houses, praying for a reversal
of that policy which has proved so
detrimental to the interests of a large
section of her Majesty's subjects.
Yet still Parliament is silent, and the
first Minister of the Crown refuses
to sanction that appeal to the country,
which the exigency of the case would
seem to require, and which has been
resorted to on occasions far less peremptory
and pressing than this.</p>

<p>Let us not be misunderstood. Our
wish simply is to record the fact of
such silence and refusal,&mdash;not to be
rash in censure. We cannot, and do
not forget the peculiar circumstances
connected with the last general election&mdash;the
political tergiversation
which preceded it, the hopes and
expectations which were then entertained
by many, as to the working of
the new system,&mdash;or the disorganisation
of parties. Even the most strenuous
opponents of the Free-Trade
measures, since these had passed into
a law, however iniquitously carried,
were desirous that the experiment
should have a fair trial, and that it
should not be impeded in its progress,
so long as, by the most liberal construction,
it could be held to justify the
anticipations of its authors. Many
names of great weight, influence, and
authority were found among the roll
of those who consented to the new
measures; and it was most natural
that, throughout the country, a number
of persons should be found willing to
surrender their own judgment upon
a matter yet untried, which had
received so creditable a sanction.
Therefore it was that the majority of
members returned to the present
House of Commons were Free-traders,
bound to the system by the double
ties of previous conviction and of
pledge; and though recent elections,
as well as the alarming posture of
affairs, have contributed materially
to alter the position of the two great
parties in the House, it would be unreasonable
as yet to look for a change,
in a body so constituted, at least to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
that extent which a reversal of the
adopted policy must imply.</p>

<p>Neither can we rationally expect,
that Lord John Russell will be forward
to recognise a failure, where he
confidently anticipated a triumph.
We believe him to have been, far
more than Sir Robert Peel, the dupe
of those random assertions and presumptuous
calculations which were
thrust forward by men utterly unfit,
from their previous habits and education,
to pronounce an opinion upon
subjects of such magnitude and intricacy.
We should not be surprised if,
even now, his Lordship had some
lingering kind of faith in the prophecies
of the member for Westbury.
Men are slow to believe that the
ground is crumbling from below their
feet; that the political scaffolding
which they assisted to rear has been
pitched in a marshy quagmire. Self
love, and that kind of pride which is
so nearly allied to conceit that it
often assumes the form of obstinacy,
stand woefully in the way of recantation;
and moreover in the present
instance to recant is equivalent to
resign. We remember well the profound
and sagacious remark of Sir
Walter Scott, that "the miscarriage
of his experiment no more converts
the political speculator, than the
explosion of a retort undeceives an
alchymist." Lord John Russell in all
probability is not yet prepared, from
conviction, to revise his opinions on a
question in which he is so deeply committed.
He has a majority in the
House of Commons, and, according to
the forms of the constitution, so long
as he can command that majority, he
is entitled to persevere. It is well
that our friends, whatever pressing
cause they may have for their impatience,
should remember these
things; and not be too forward in
pressing wholesale accusations, either
against a Parliament chosen under
such peculiar circumstances, or a
Minister who is simply adhering to
the course long since avowed by himself,
and acted on by his immediate
predecessor. We may regret, and
many of us do unquestionably most
bitterly feel, the anomalous position
in which we are placed. A more
cruel, a more galling thought can
hardly be imagined than the conviction
which is very general abroad,
and which is also ours, that the present
Parliament does not represent the
feelings or the desires of the people;
that it is not consulting their welfare
or protecting their interests; and
that the duration of that Parliament
alone prevents a vigorous and successful
effort in the cause of British
industry. Yet still, while we feel all
this, let us not be unjust to others.
We cannot coerce opinion. We cannot
force honourable members at once
to retrace their steps, or to give the
lie to their acknowledged pledges.
We cannot complain of open wrong
if Ministers decline to accept our
voices, in lieu of the voices of those
whom we formerly sent as representatives.
Their answer and vindication
lies in the fact of their Parliamentary
majority. Why Parliament should
thus be placed in direct antagonism
to the country, is a very different
question. We need not go far in
search of the reason. It is the direct
consequence of that policy which Sir
Robert Peel thought fit to adopt,
not with regard to the abstract
measures of Free Trade, but for the
carrying of these measures into effect,
without an appeal to the country,
and by means which proved how
closely deceit is allied to tyranny.
Upon his head, if not the whole, at
least the primary responsibility rests.
He has accepted it, and let it abide
with him. And let no man affirm
that, in saying this, we are prolonging
any rancorous feeling, or seeking
to rub a sore which by this time
should be wellnigh healed. The
time for indignation and anger, if
injury coupled with perfidy can ever
provoke such sentiments, is not yet
past; it is now in its fullest force.
Had Sir Robert Peel acted as he
ought to have done&mdash;had he played
the part of a British statesman,
sincerely desirous that in a matter
of such magnitude the will of the
country should be respected&mdash;the
present Parliament, whatever might
have been its decision as to Free
Trade or Protection, would at least
have represented the wishes of the
electoral body; and if subsequent
events had shown that these wishes
were more sanguine than wise, the
error would have been a national one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and no weight of individual responsibility
would have been incurred.
As it is, we are not only justified,
but we are performing our duty, in
indicating the real and sole originator
of our present difficulties; and without
wishing in any degree to trench
upon his secret sources of consolation,
we can hardly imagine that he
will derive much comfort from the
knowledge, that his tortuous policy
has deprived the people in the hour
of need of their best constitutional
privilege and shield&mdash;the sympathy
and co-operation of that House
which is emphatically their own,
and which, to the great detriment of
the state, must lose its moral power
the moment that it ceases to represent
the will, and to protect the
interests of the Commons.</p>

<p>We are well aware that such reflections
as these can bring but sorry
comfort to the farmers. Their situation
is one of unparalleled hardship,
unrelieved by any consideration
which can make the case of other
sufferers more tolerable. We fully
admit the vast extent of the powers
which, since the Great Revolution,
are held to be vested in Parliaments.
We cannot gainsay the doctrine that
these powers may, on occasion, be
exerted to the uttermost; but we
say, after the most careful and
thoughtful deliberation, that the proceedings
of the legislature with regard
to the farmers of Great Britain
are irreconcilable with the principles
of justice, with the sacred laws of
morality, which no legislative resolutions
can abrogate or annul. The
farmers are entitled to maintain that,
in so far as regards them, the public
faith has been broken. Such of them
as hold leases had a distinct and
unqualified guarantee given to them
by the protective laws; and the
allegation that the substitution of
the sliding-scale for a fixed duty
acted as a release for all former
Parliamentary engagements, is a
quibble so mean and wretched that
the basest attorney would be ashamed
to use it as a plea. The whole of the
farmers' fixed and floating capital,
estimated at the enormous sum of five
hundred millions sterling, has been
laid out on the faith of Protection; and
yet when that Protection was furtively
and treacherously withdrawn, no
measure was introduced for the purpose
of relieving them from engagements
contracted under the older
system, which were obviously incompatible
with the lowered prices
established by the formidable change.
The public, we are afraid, are not
aware of the extent of that depreciation
which is still going on, <em>and
which already exceeds the whole annual
value of the manufacturing productions
of Great Britain</em>. We borrow
the following table from a late
pamphlet by Mr Macqueen entitled,
"Statistics of Agriculture, Manufactures,
and Commerce, drawn up from
Official and Authentic Documents;"
and having tested it by every means
in our power, we have no hesitation
in adopting it. It is, in truth, a fearful
commentary on the rashness and
folly of our rulers.</p>

<p>But this is not all. We have still
to deal with the depreciation or diminished
value of the farmers' fixed
capital, invested in live stock, &amp;c.,
which at the rate of 25 per cent,
(a most moderate calculation, and
below the mark in so far as Scotland
is concerned,) shows a loss
on £504,833,730 of £126,208,432
<em>additional</em>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>We put forward the case of the
farmers thus prominently, because, in
addition to the great public wrong
which has been done to them, they
have serious reason to complain of
the general apathy of the landlords.
We do not allude to the part which
the landowners took in 1846. We
believe that the majority of them
were sincerely disgusted by the conduct
of the men who had climbed
into office on their shoulders; and that
they loathed and despised in their
hearts the treachery of which they
were made the tools. We know,
moreover, that a great many of them
abstained from taking part in the
election of 1847, not being able to
see their way through the political
chaos in which we were then involved,
and having, naturally enough,
lost confidence in the probity of public
men, and despairing of the remodelment
of a strong constitutional
party. Such things were, perhaps,
inevitable; and it may be argued with
much show of reason, that no better
line of conduct was open to the landlords,
and that they did wisely in
reserving themselves for a more favourable
opportunity, when experience,
that stern and unfailing monitor, should
have exposed to the Free-traders
the falsity of their wild expectations.
But it is impossible for them now to
plead that the opportunity has not
arrived. The experiment has been
made, and has failed&mdash;failed utterly
and entirely, if the practical refutation
of the views advanced by all its leading
advocates is to be considered as
equivalent to failure. The current of
reaction has set in strong and steady,
not only in the counties, but in the
towns; not only among those who, from
their position, must be the earliest
sufferers, but among those who are
connected with the trade and general
commerce of Britain. The disorganised
party has rallied and is reformed
under leaders of great talent,
tried skill, and most assured loyalty
and honour. How is it that, in this
posture of affairs, any considerable section
of the landlords is still hanging
back? Why is it that they do not
place themselves, as is their duty, at
the head of their tenantry, and enforce
and encourage those appeals to public
justice, and to public policy, which are
now making themselves heard in every
quarter of the kingdom? We confess
that we are at a loss to know why
any apathy should be shown. The conduct
of the tenantry towards the landlords
has been generous and considerate
in the extreme. They were invited, in
no equivocal terms, to join their cause
with that of the Free-traders and financial
reformers; and they were promised,
in that event, the cordial assistance
of the latter towards the adjustment
of their rents, and the equalisation
of their public burdens. We venture
not an opinion whether such promise
was ever intended to be kept. Still it
was made; and no effort was left untried
to convince the farmers that
their cause was separate and apart
from that of the owners of the land.
Their refusal to enter into that unholy
alliance was most honourable to the
body of the tenantry, and entitles
them, at the hands of the proprietors,
to look not only for consideration and
sympathy, but for the most active and
energetic support. Very ill indeed
shall we augur of the spirit and
patriotism of the gentlemen of England,
if they longer abstain from identifying
themselves universally with a movement
which is not only a national
one, in the strictest sense of the word,
but upon which depends the maintenance
of their own interests and order.
Surely they cannot have been so dull
or so deaf to what is passing around
them, as not to be aware that they
were especially marked out as the
victims of the Manchester confederacy!
These are not times in which any man
can afford to be apathetic, nor will
any trivial excuse for languor or indifference
be accepted. Exalted position,
high character, the reputation
for princely generosity, and the best
of private reputations, will be no apology
for inactivity in a crisis so momentous
as this. Organisation, union,
and energy are at all times the chief
means for insuring success; and we
trust that, henceforward, there may be
less timidity shown by those who
ought to take the foremost rank in a
contest of such importance, and who
cannot abstain longer from doing so
without forfeiting their claim to that
regard which has hitherto been readily
accorded them.</p>

<p>It will be observed that, as yet, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
have put the case for Protection upon
very narrow grounds. We have
shown that, so far as the agricultural
body is concerned, Free Trade has
proved most injurious, and that it
cannot be persisted in without bringing
downright ruin to that section of
the community. If we had nothing
more to advance than this, still we
should be entitled to maintain that
enough has been adduced to show the
necessity of retracing our steps. The
annihilation of such an important
body as the agriculturists of Britain,
implies of itself a revolution as great
as ever was effected in the world; and
to that, assuredly, if the agriculturists
stood alone, they would not tamely
submit. When Mr Cobden or his
satellites addressed the people of Manchester,
through their League circulars,
to the following effect, "If the Americans
will only put down their monopolising
manufacturers, and we put
down our monopolising landowners
here, when our election time comes,
we will lay the Mississippi valley
alongside of Manchester, and we will
have a glorious trade then!"&mdash;and
again, "Our doctrine is, let the working
man ply his hammer, or his
spindle, or his shuttle, and let the
Kentucky or the Illinois farmer, by
driving his plough in the richest land
on the surface of the earth, feed this
mechanic or this weaver, and let him
send home his produce in exchange
for the products of our operatives and
artisans"&mdash;they seem to have forgotten
the temper and mould of the men with
whom they proposed to deal so summarily.
It is not quite so easy to expatriate
three millions of able-bodied
men; nor do we opine that a power
morally or physically adequate to the
task of such removal exists in the
manufacturing districts. But, in
reality, of all idle talk that ever issued
from the lips or the pen of an inflated
demagogue, this is the silliest and the
worst. It presupposes an amount of
ignorance on the part of his audience
anything but flattering to the calibre
of the Manchester intellect: indeed
we hardly know which is most to be
admired&mdash;its intense and transparent
folly or its astounding audacity. The
home trade is a thing altogether kept
out of account in the foregoing
splendid vision of a calico millennium.
Mr Cobden, it will be seen, contemplates
no home consumption, except
in so far as the operative may provide
himself with his own shirtings.
The whole production of Britain is to
be limited to manufactures; the whole
supplies are to be derived from the
hands of the reciprocating foreigner!</p>

<p>There does not exist in this great
and populous country any one class
the labour of which can be restricted,
or the profits curtailed, without an
injurious result to the interests of the
whole community. This is not simply
a maxim of political economy; it is
a distinct physical fact, which no ingenuity
can controvert. Yet, strange
to say, our rulers have acted, and are
acting, with regard to by far the most
important class of the country, as if
no such fact were known; and they
now profess to be amazed at its speedy
and inevitable consequence. That
agricultural distress must react upon
the manufacturer, the trader, shopkeeper,
and artisan, is as necessary a
consequence as is a failure in the
supply of water after a long-continued
drought. If our taxation is artificial,
and our national establishments costly,
it must not be forgotten that our private
expenditure is generally on the
same scale. We consume within the
country a far greater amount of manufactures
than we can ever hope to export,
and the only limit to that consumption
is the power of purchase.
The profits of the landowner, which
depend upon the value of produce, do
not constitute a fund which is removed
from public circulation. On the contrary,
these profits furnish the means
of labour and employment to the
greater portion of the industrious
classes, who otherwise would have no
resource; and if they are violently
curtailed, it must needs follow that
a large amount of employment is withdrawn.
That is precisely our case at
the present moment. By the admission
of foreign produce, which is in
fact foreign labour, the value of agricultural
production in this country has
fallen very nearly thirty per cent, and
the consequence is a greatly diminished
expenditure, and a slackening
of employment grievously felt by those
who are supported by manual labour.
How, indeed, is it possible that it can
be otherwise? A very little thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
must convince every one that all incomes
in Britain must depend upon
the amount and value of the national
production, and that, by reducing and
lowering that, a direct attack is made
upon the profits of every kind of
labour. It is singular that consequence
so plain should ever have been
overlooked; still more singular that
statesmen should have been found to
maintain an opposite theory. The
only explanation we can suggest as
to this singular departure from the leading
principles of economical science
is, that of late years Ministers have
habitually consulted the interests of
the capitalists rather than those of the
people. Sir Robert Peel has invariably
shown himself a capitalist legislator.
At the outset of his career,
and while under the Israelitish guidance
of Ricardo, he succeeded in carrying
those Currency measures which
increased by nearly one-third the
weight of the national obligations.
Later in life we find him engaged in
measures of arbitrary bank restriction,
thereby occasioning commercial panics,
and securing another rich harvest for
the moneyed class. His tariffs and
Free-trade measures exhibit precisely
the same tendency. They are all
constructed with a view to cheapness,
or, what is the same thing, to the
diminution of the value of labour, so
that the fortune of the capitalist or
fundholder is now virtually doubled:
while the industrious classes, with a
lowered rate of wage, are compelled
to undergo the additional evil of unrestricted
foreign competition.</p>

<p>Let us now, for a brief space, proceed
to consider the internal adjustment
of the strength and industry of
Britain. It is a subject well worthy
of study, especially at the present
moment, when a general feeling of
perplexity prevails, and when those
who unfortunately gave ear to the
specious representations of the Free-traders
are convinced of their error,
but are yet in doubt whether it be
possible to retrace our steps. It is a
subject, moreover, upon which we are
bound to enter, seeing that official
cunning has been used to conceal the
real posture of affairs in this country,
and, by undervaluing the magnitude
of some interests, to give a factitious
and altogether imaginary importance
to others. We trust that we shall be
able to show, to the satisfaction of
our readers, the gross extent to which
this kind of delusion and imposture
has been carried.</p>

<p>Upon no subject whatever are more
erroneous impressions entertained,
than upon the relative importance and
strength of the two great classes of
the country. Of late it has been
quietly assumed that the manufacturers
are infinitely superior to the
agriculturists, not only in point of
numbers, but in respect of capital employed
or available; and many people
have been puzzled to understand why,
if this should be the case, such vehement
opposition should be made to
any proposal for readjusting the direct
and local taxation, which confessedly
weighs most heavily upon the proprietors
and occupiers of the land.
We have been told, in as many words,
that henceforward the voice of the
towns is to dictate the policy of Britain&mdash;that
the agriculturists are a
worn-out class, scarce worth preserving&mdash;and
the most influential of the
Free-trade journals has not hesitated
to recommend a wholesale emigration
to the Antipodes, or any portion of the
surface of the globe where corn can be
cultivated cheaper than in England.
We have been not only taunted, but
threatened, whenever we presumed to
expostulate. Reference was made to
certain "masses," who were ready to
rise in defence of perennial cheapness;
and Mr Cobden has warned us not to
provoke the exercise of that power
which is vested in himself, as dictator
of the democracy. In short, we have
been given to understand that, if protection
to native industry, in any
shape, should be re-introduced&mdash;which
only can be done by the will and legitimate
sanction of Parliament&mdash;physical
force shall not be wanting on the
other side.</p>

<p>The use of such language argues
great ignorance of the national
temper. We have heard a good
deal lately of what is termed the
dogged Anglo-Saxon spirit, the main
characteristic of which we take to be
its decided antagonism to bullying,
and its inveterate hatred of coercion.
It is too much to expect that a controversy
such as this should be conducted
without some asperity of language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and therefore we make no clamorous
complaint when Mr Cobden,
or his friends, think proper to designate
the British agriculturists as
"ignorant clodpoles" and "horse-shoe
idiots," or the landed proprietors
as "a selfish and degraded faction,"
or the Protectionist press as the
"hireling tools of oppression." These
are very old and very harmless terms
of rhetoric, and we are not sure that
we can claim entire vindication from
the charge of having retorted with
tolerable energy. The real danger
begins when men step beyond constitutional
limits, and advocate resistance
to the legislature by appealing
to the passions, as they have pandered
to the prejudices, of the mob.</p>

<p>Having premised so much, we think
no one can misinterpret our motives,
if we set ourselves seriously to the
task of refuting a great fallacy which
has been hatched and propagated by
the Free-traders. It is one so monstrous
in itself that we hardly could
have supposed that any man, who had
reflected for a moment on the subject,
could have yielded to the delusion:
nevertheless, we believe it to be most
common, and it has been over and
over again repeated at public meetings,
until it has lost its quality as an
assertion, and been treated as a recognised
fact. It is within the recollection
of all of us, that, both within the
walls of Parliament and at the great
outward gatherings of the League, the
superiority of the manufacturing over
the agricultural interest of Great Britain
was broadly asserted, and assumed
as the basis of the leading argument
of the Free-traders. Sir Robert Peel
expressly adopted this view in 1846,
while advocating the repeal of the
policy, which he had hitherto professed
to support; we say, <em>professed</em>, because
no man now doubts&mdash;indeed, it
is fairly admitted by himself, with
something like a sneer of triumph&mdash;that
for many years he had been
practising a deliberate imposture on
the public. This view necessarily
must have had some foundation on
authority, if not on fact; and we can
trace that authority to a statistical
writer, Mr Porter, on whose accuracy,
and method of dealing with figures,
far too much reliance has been placed
by statesmen high in office.</p>

<p>In dealing with the census of 1841,
and compiling his tables with a view
to show the relative occupations of
the people, Mr Porter has adopted
the ingenious plan of massing commerce,
trade, and manufactures together,
and exhibiting the aggregate
of these in contradistinction to the
purely agricultural interest! At page
55 of the last edition of his <cite>Progress
of the Nation</cite> we find this statement&mdash;"The
following more elaborate table
of the occupations of the population
of Great Britain, as ascertained in
1841, his been compiled from the
Reports of the Census Commissioners.
<em>It affords the best abstract</em> that has
hitherto been attainable upon this
important branch of political arithmetic."</p>

<p>We turn to the table indicated in
this modest passage, and we find the
following results for Great Britain
alone:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="GB">
<tr><td align="left">Persons engaged in commerce, trade, and manufacture,</td><td align="right">3,092,787</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Agriculture,</td><td align="right">1,490,785</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Labour not agricultural,</td><td align="right">758,495</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This, of course, is exclusive of the
army, navy, learned professions,
domestic servants, and various other
employments, besides women and
children. In another table, Mr Porter,
estimating the male population of
Great Britain, (excluding Ireland,)
who were then upwards of twenty
years of age, at 4,761,091, divides
them thus:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="males">
<tr><td align="left">Agriculture,</td><td align="left">1,198,156</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Trade, manufactures, &amp;c.,</td><td align="left">2,125,496</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Other classes,</td><td align="left">1,437,439</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="right" class="bt">4,761,091</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>If, as Mr Spackman most properly
observes in his excellent work, the
<cite>Analysis of the Occupations of the
People</cite>, one of the principal objects of
taking the census is to trace the
relative degree of dependence of one
class upon another, how can this be
done if all the trade and commerce of
the country is to be mixed up with
manufactures? "Mr Porter would
have us to consider trade and commerce,
<em>and manufactures</em> as synonymous
terms, and that together they
only form one class; and he seems to
be so thoroughly haunted with the
numerical weakness of the manufacturing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
interest, that his fear of its
being discovered peeps out in every
paragraph; and, by mixing them up in
every table in which they are mentioned
in his book, with those engaged
in trade and commerce, he has
effectually succeeded in his object."</p>

<p>As we propose to lay before our
readers the results of Mr Spackman,
it may be proper shortly to state
the principles which have guided
him in his classification of the
official returns. He recognises but
two great classes of the community
engaged in the production of wealth,
and upon these he justly considers
the whole of the remainder to be
dependent. The following extract
from his preface will sufficiently
explain his view:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Of the number of persons actually employed
by the agriculturists and manufacturers,
no difference of opinion can exist,
as we have adopted the Government classification
in every instance, and copied the
figures given in the returns. We believe
this classification to be correct in principle,
and but slightly erroneous in
details.</p>

<p>"Political economists may exercise
their ingenuity by calling in question this
classification, but we believe it is the
only one that accurately traces the dependence
of an individual on the one or
the other interest; and, as this is the
primary object of all such matters, if it
attains this end, it is sufficient for all
purposes. By the landed interest we
mean not only the proprietors of the soil,
but all that are engaged in its cultivation,
and all the interests that are
dependent on and supported by both
landlord and tenant. An agriculturist
is one who grows the raw material. The
manufacturer changes the fabric from
cotton into calico, flax into linen, wool
into cloth, raw into manufactured silk,
mineral ores into various combinations
of metals, and the skin of an animal into
leather.</p>

<p>"All besides the agriculturists and
the manufacturers are auxiliaries, not
principals. Thus the handicraftsman
alters the form, but not the substance,
and adapts the article to the use of the
consumer,&mdash;so the miller, baker, and
butcher; the tailor, milliner, and shoemaker.</p>

<p>"There is also a very numerous class,
who neither produce, manufacture, nor
alter the shape or substance of an article,
and these are called merchants, if they
buy and sell in a wholesale manner, or
shopkeepers and retail dealers if they
sell by retail. The business of these is
to distribute all articles imported from
abroad or produced at home, through
every city, town, and village, in the
United Kingdom; and the Government
definition of all these auxiliaries is
'engaged in trade and commerce.'</p>

<p>"The dependence of any particular
class engaged in trade and commerce, or
in handicraft, is not upon the party who
produces, alters, or supplies the article,
but on the individual who consumes it;
and if there is any tax whatever on the
raw material, or on anything used in its
manufacture, adaptation, or distribution,
it is on him that all and every item of
such tax, together with all profits and
charges, must ultimately fall.</p>

<p>"Inasmuch, however, as there is no
wealth in this country of any amount, but
what has been derived either from agriculture
or manufactures, nor any of
which the value is not determined by
the success of these, so again this consumer,
whatever his rank or position in
society may be, is mainly dependent on
them. The rental of land, the income
from houses, or investments in the public
funds, are merely the representatives of
so much labour; and the means necessary
to pay them are principally drawn from
either agriculture or manufactures.</p>

<p>"Our annual creation of wealth may
be thus stated:&mdash;</p></blockquote>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="annual">
<tr><td align="left">Agriculture,</td><td align="right">£250,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Manufactures, deducting the value of the raw material,</td><td align="right">127,000,000</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="right" class="bt">£450,000,000"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><em>And from one or other of these does
every individual in the land derive his income
or means of support.</em> The Peer
of the realm, the landed proprietor,
the Government annuitant, the clergyman,
the medical and the legal adviser,
with the banker, merchant, dealer, and
handicraftsman of every class and
kind,&mdash;derive what is necessary to
support their state and condition, and
their daily sustenance, from these
spring-heads of national wealth.
This is the substance of the nation,
and what we call money consists
merely of the counters we use to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
denote and measure the value of this
substance as it passes from one to
another.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To do equal justice to all classes, the
legislation of a country ought, therefore,
to keep steadily in view their relative
importance, not only as regards numbers,
but also their powers of production, and
the proportion which they severally bear
of the national burdens. Unless this is
the governing principle, it strikes at the
root of their prosperity, and the injury
inflicted on a class is evinced in the
gradual decay of the whole community."</p></blockquote>

<p>Acting upon these distinct, and, we
submit, perfectly sound principles,
Mr Spackman has compiled his tables
in the following manner. The Government
returns are quite explicit as to
the number of those engaged directly
in agriculture and in manufactures.
Mr Spackman takes each county
separately; and having set down the
relative numbers of each class, he
divides the remainder of the population
between these according to their proportion.
For example, let us instance
his table of the county of Lanark,
which is the great seat of Scottish
manufactures. We find, from the
official returns, that the following
numbers are directly engaged:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="divided">
<tr><td align="left">In Agriculture,</td><td align="right">13,169</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">In Manufactures of all kinds,</td><td align="right">61,378</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The residue of the population being
352,425, he divides in the same
proportion, and thus gives us as a
result:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Engaged in Agriculture,</td><td align="right">13,169</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Dependent on,</td><td align="right" class="bb">62,257</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="right">75,426</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Engaged in Manufactures,</td><td align="right">61,378</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Dependent on,</td><td align="right" class="bb">290,168</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="right" class="bb">351,546</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">Total of county,</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="right">426,972</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In the same way, by estimating the
population of Perthshire directly
employed in agriculture and manufactures,
Mr Spackman forms his
table thus,&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="engaged">
<tr><td align="left">Engaged in Agriculture,</td><td align="right">16,302</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Dependent on,</td><td align="right" class="bb">64,233</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="right">80,535</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Engaged in Manufactures,</td><td align="right">11,509</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Dependent on,</td><td align="right" class="bb">45,346</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="right" class="bb">56,855</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">Total of County,</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="right">137,390</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The grand result for the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
is as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="grand result">
<tr><td align="left">Engaged in, and dependent on agriculture,</td><td align="right">18,734,468</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Engaged in, and dependent on manufactures,</td><td align="right">8,091,621</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Population, exclusive of those travelling on night of census,</td><td align="right" class="bt">26,826,089</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Lest it should be said that Mr
Spackman has acted upon any wrong
principle in framing these tables&mdash;for
we know by experience that a certain
class of political economists can see no
virtue in any figures which are not of
their own construction&mdash;let us turn to
the Government reports, and extract
from them the number of males <em>directly</em>
employed in the two great branches of
production.</p>


<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap">Agriculture.</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="agriculture">
<tr><td align="left">Farmers and Graziers,</td><td align="right">737,206</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Agricultural Labourers,</td><td align="right">2,312,388</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Gardeners, Nurserymen, &amp;c.</td><td align="right">60,767</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">All others,</td><td align="right">9,196</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">Total Males,</td><td align="right" class="bt">3,118,557</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap">Manufactures.</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="manufactures">
<tr><td align="left">Above 20,</td><td align="right">717,780</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Under 20,</td><td align="right">168,964</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">Total Males,</td><td align="right" class="bt">886,744</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>"It will thus be seen," says Mr
Spackman, "that the farmers and
graziers alone, as a body, are more
in number than all the males above
twenty years of age employed in
manufactures, and only 150,000 short
of the whole number of males of all
ages so employed. If we add the two
and a quarter millions of labourers
which these farmers and graziers give
employment to, the <em>male</em> population
employed in agriculture are nearly as
four to one compared with those employed
in manufactures. The same
remark will also apply as to age: those
above twenty are four to one; those
under twenty are nearly two to one."</p>

<p>We put forward these statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
with no other view than to exhibit to
our readers the national importance
of that agricultural interest which has
been so bitterly assailed, and which
is threatened still by a heavier accession
of calamity. If the bastard system
of Free Trade is to be considered
according to its influence on the welfare
of the majority of the people of
Britain, there can be no doubt to
which side the vast preponderance
belongs. The "horse-shoe idiots,"
though dull in intellect, are numerous
in the flesh to an extent of which,
perhaps, even Mr Cobden was little
aware. It is quite true that the extended
area over which they are disposed
does not afford them the same
means of combination which are within
the reach of the inhabitants of the
factories. The agriculturalists have no
wish to interfere with their neighbours'
livelihood, and little inclination to
move at the bidding of mercenary demagogues.
They seldom speak until
suffering or a sense of injustice compels
them to appeal to the legislature:
and their unwillingness to join in
agitation has, ere now, been made
subject of taunt against them. Were
it otherwise, we should not attach
one half the importance which we do
to the movement which is visible all
over the face of agricultural England&mdash;a
movement which the advocates
of Free Trade may affect to despise,
but which, in reality, has struck them
with consternation. And no wonder
that the movement should have been
made. Let us pass from the mere
numerical consideration, and look to the
extent of property which is embarked
on the one side and on the other.</p>

<p>We have already stated the annual
value of the agricultural production of
these kingdoms to be £250,000,000,
whilst that of manufactures is little
more than £127,000,000. To
this latter sum we must add about
£50,000,000, being the estimated cost
of the raw material, if we wish to calculate
from the exports the importance
of the home market compared with
that which is to be found abroad.
For example, if the declared value of
the exports shall amount to 69 millions,
we are entitled to assume that
about 117 millions are consumed at
home in a year of ordinary prosperity.
This, of course, is no more than an
approximation to the truth, but it is
the nearest which can be made from
such documents, reports, and returns,
as are accessible to the statist. Let
us take Mr Spackman's estimate of
the capital employed, referring our
readers for the details to his exceedingly
interesting work.</p>

<p>The first reflection which must
come home to the mind of every one
who considers these tables, is the
astounding audacity of those who
have characterised the landlords as a
grasping and rapacious class. Singular,
nay, almost incredible as it
may appear, the annual value of the
production of manufactures is nearly
double the amount of the whole capital
invested. This fact sufficiently
explains the manner in which so
many colossal fortunes have been
realised, while it also suggests very
painful reflections as to the condition
of the operatives who are the creators
of all this wealth. But what are we
to think of the conduct of the men
who, not content with such enormous
returns, have leagued together to
swell them to a greater amount, by
demanding the free importation of
foreign produce, under the pretext
that the people were oppressed by the
continuance of a system which gave
remunerative prices, continuous employment,
and the means of livelihood
to two-thirds of their aggregate
number? We acquit many of the
leading and most respectable manufacturers
from being participators in
any such scheme. Those connected
with the home trade have very generally
been opposed to the application
of the Free-trade doctrines, the
leading advocates of which were
comprised of men who manufactured
solely for exportation, and whose
goods were neither intended nor
adapted for British consumption. It
was for the exclusive benefit, as at
the instigation of the latter, that the
Corn Laws were repealed. Few can
be sorry&mdash;we confess we are not&mdash;that
even they have been disappointed
in their expectations. No tariffs have
been relaxed in consequence of the
ill-omened surrender; on the contrary,
the Continental states, as well
as the Americans, are protecting their
own manufactures with increased
vigilance; whilst, on the other hand,
they are availing themselves of our
folly, by deluging our market with
their agricultural produce, securing
by these means the double advantage
of promoting both branches of industry.
Never was there a vainer
notion than the chimera that other
states would abandon their rising
manufactures to reciprocate with
Great Britain, when that haughty
power had deliberately deprived herself
of the means of enforcing reciprocity.
<em>The countries from which we
import the largest amount of grain are
not the countries which take the largest
amount of our manufactures.</em> Even
if the case were otherwise, we maintain
that we should be heavy losers,
and in no way gainers, by the transaction.
Nationally, this is so clear
that we need not waste words by
arguing the point; but we go further
and say that, even had other states
reciprocated, the manufacturers, as a
body, could not have been gainers by
Free Trade, unless the relative proportions
between the amount of
home and foreign consumption had
been entirely changed. For, so long
as two-thirds of our whole manufactures
are annually consumed in Britain,
the condition of the consumers
there, and their power of purchase,
must be a matter of greater importance
to the manufacturer than that of
consumers abroad. The interest of
the shopkeepers and of the artisans is
almost entirely bound up with the home
trade; and nothing can be more suicidal
to the traders than to give
any countenance to a system which
strikes at the amount of their profits,
by crippling the means of their customers.</p>

<p>Were our object merely to show
the glaring injustice which has been
done to the landed interest, we could
proceed much further in disentangling
details from the confusion into which
they have been purposely thrown, by
such statistical writers as Mr Porter.
But we apprehend that, in the present
temper of the nation, there is little
occasion for this. Men of all classes
have had that opportunity which experience
can alone give, of testing in
their own individual case the advantages
which were so confidently predicted
by those who advocated the
commercial change. Those who have
benefited by it will, of course, remain
Free traders. We are not unreasonable
enough to expect that they will
abandon that policy which is profitable
to themselves, even though they
should be convinced that it has proved
the reverse of profitable to others.
But we can conscientiously say, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
we are acquainted with very few such
persons. In the country they do not
exist: in the towns, we hear of nothing
except continued and weary depression.
Almost every day fresh complaints of
want of employment are thrust upon
us. Establishments are reduced, because
those who were considered
wealthy, and those whose wealth depended
upon produce, have no longer the
means to support them as before:
even professional incomes are declining:
and no one ventures now to
indulge in that expenditure which,
four or five years ago, gave an impulse
to the industry of the people.
All this we believe to be acknowledged,
and we have heard it from
the lips of many whose political
creed is quite at variance with our
own.</p>

<p>Most important testimony to the
same effect was borne, at the recent
meeting in Liverpool, by gentlemen
who, from profession and connection,
belong to the mercantile and trading classes
of the community. It is no
vague apprehension of coming evil,
no slight or ephemeral touch of distress,
which has elicited declarations
of opinion so strong as were there
expressed. The urgency of the case
is felt and acknowledged; and ere
long we have not the slightest doubt
that demonstrations of similar magnitude
and importance will take place
in other of the English towns.</p>

<p>From what we have already said,
it will be gathered that we recommend
no hasty or precipitate movement.
Our strength lies in the justice
of our cause, and in the palpable
failure of the measures against which
we have emphatically protested.
This is not a question of mere sentiment,
regarding which men can long
continue to maintain divided opinions.
It is a practical question, affecting not
only the general welfare of the kingdom,
but the property and means of
every man who lives and thrives
through his industry. It is essentially
a labour question, and, as such, it
cannot long remain without receiving
a distinct solution. In the mean
time, however, it is our duty to make
preparation for the change which may
arrive at no distant period. The
various Protection societies which
are everywhere organised, offer to
those who condemn the present line of
policy the best opportunity of concentrating
their efforts, and of contributing
to the ultimate triumph of
the cause. These societies must be
supported, for, under existing
circumstances, they are of the utmost value.
They present a ready channel through
which the wishes and situation of the
people can be communicated to the legislature
or the throne; they establish
and preserve communication between
neighbouring districts; and
they supply useful information, and
disseminate sound principles, in quarters
where good political knowledge is
most especially required. We trust
that no one who entertains opinions
similar to our own, and who is deeply
impressed with the necessity of a return
to the just system of Protection,
will be backward in lending his aid to
these institutions. From the peculiar
position of the agricultural party, such
combinations are absolutely necessary,
in order to arrive at a just estimate of
our strength, and the true sentiments
of the nation. Private efforts, however
energetically made, are ineffectual
in compassion with this system of
union and of order; and although we
know that agitation is in itself a thing
distasteful to many, the emergency of
the case is such that we are imperatively
bound to adopt all legitimate
means for the furtherance of our
object. It may be that under no
circumstances whatever can redress be
obtained from the present Parliament.
We have already adverted to the
peculiar causes which would seem to
render such an expectation at best a
forlorn hope; yet still that furnishes
no reason for relaxing in our efforts.
The Whig Ministry&mdash;by the confession
of men of all parties&mdash;has a most
precarious tenure of office. Already
the House of Peers has passed its
gravest censure upon the course of
foreign policy which has been pursued&mdash;a
course of which it is difficult
to say whether its most prominent
feature is culpable recklessness or
glaring dishonesty. We do not know
what may be the decision of the House
of Commons upon a point of such
importance, or whether unscrupulous
influence, and the dread of a dissolution,
may not overcome the dictates of
honour and the force of private judgement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in the more popular assembly.
But, whatever may be the fiat of the
Commons, this at least is clear, that
a severe blow has been given to the
stability of the Whig Government. Beyond
the walls of Parliament they
have hardly any support upon a question
which threatens to involve us
in direct hostility with France; and
nothing could have more effectually
damaged them, even in this wretched
business, than the acerbity of the tone
assumed by Lord John Russell with
regard to the European powers, who
are most justly incensed at the paltering
and bad faith of the political incendiary
who, to the misfortune of
this country, has been intrusted
with the management of foreign
affairs. Neither the honour nor the
interests of Britain are safe in such
hands. Therefore we say to the men
of the Country Party&mdash;Be prepared to
act, for no one can tell how soon the
moment for action may arrive. Ours
is a great cause, and it must not be
imperilled by slothfulness or inactivity
at a crisis which requires the
exertion of all our energies, and the
combination of all our powers. Let
us but be true to ourselves, and
ultimate success is certain. Delusions
may for a time have taken hold
of the public mind; but the endurance
of all delusions is short, and the mist
is rapidly dissipating. Let any man
compare the state of public feeling as
it exists now, with what it was but
twelve months ago, and he cannot fail
to be impressed with the amazing
rapidity of the change. And yet, why
should he wonder at it? The industry
of the nation is at stake, and what
marvel that the people should demand
their own?</p>

<p>That cheapness of itself is no blessing,
even our opponents admit in the
arguments which they try to direct
against us. Read their accounts of
the squalidness and poverty which
prevail in the larger towns&mdash;the testimony
which has been laboriously collected
as to the lamentable fall of
wages, and the diminished profits of
thousands employed in the lower kinds
of handicraft. Undoubtedly competition
among themselves has contributed
to this state of matters; but in no
degree at all commensurate to the
great decline which has taken place
since we commenced the ruinous system
of reducing customs duties. Mr
Joseph Hume once ventured to maintain,
in the House of Commons, "that
England might exist and prosper as a
purely manufacturing and commercial
country, if it did not grow a single
bushel of corn,&mdash;if, in exchange for its
manufactures and minerals, it imported
from the cheap corn-producing
countries every quarter of wheat required
in this country!" How far
that statement is compatible with the
ascertained sources of the national
wealth, we leave our readers to decide.
This much, however, we shall say, that
England, so situated, would be a very
different country from that which we
have known; and that the wildernesses
of the West would offer a place of abode
infinitely preferable to that which we
could enjoy here under the gentle sway
of the Millocrats, and the enlightened
legislation of the Economists.</p>
